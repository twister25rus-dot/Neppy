# Measure the dependency floor of a build profile.
#
# The kernel-profile invariant: `--no-default-features --features flows` is the
# surface a second host would embed, and it must not grow. This script is the
# metric behind that ratchet (see `scripts/check-kernel-floor.sh` and the CI job).
#
# Three numbers, because they answer different questions and are easy to confuse:
#
#   packages  name+version lines. Two major versions of one crate count twice.
#             This is compile units — what you pay in build time.
#   names     unique crate names. Duplicated majors collapse. This is supply
#             chain surface — how many distinct projects you trust.
#   native    crates with a build script that shells out to a C/C++/asm
#             toolchain. This is what makes a build need cc/cmake/pkg-config.
#
# `cargo tree` prints ` (*)` on a subtree it already expanded. Those lines are
# back-references, NOT additional dependencies — counting them inflates the
# total (the 456-vs-454 discrepancy in the original audit was exactly this).
# We strip the marker and deduplicate.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/kernel-floor.sh                    # default features
#   scripts/kernel-floor.sh flows              # --no-default-features --features flows
#   scripts/kernel-floor.sh flows --json
#   scripts/kernel-floor.sh --all-features
