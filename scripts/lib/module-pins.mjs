/**
 * The record names listed in `pub const ALL`, in order.
 *
 * Line comments are stripped BEFORE splitting on commas, not filtered out after.
 * Splitting first puts a standalone `// …` line and the record beneath it in the
 * SAME token, so filtering tokens that begin with `//` discarded the record with
 * the comment. `ALL` carries no comments today, so this was latent rather than
 * live — but the records it lists are heavily commented individually, the list is
 * where a "why is this one eager" note would naturally go, and a dropped record
 * reads downstream as "missing from PIN_MAP": the gate would fail CI while
 * pointing at the wrong thing entirely. Raised by CodeRabbit on #5812.
