// Detects drift between what the desktop product is supposed to ship and the
// gates the Tauri shell forwards to its embedded copy of the core crate.
//
// THREE ASSERTIONS, in order of strength:
//
//   1. The shell forwards EXACTLY `scripts/ci/product-features.txt` — set
//      equality, both directions. This is the load-bearing one.
//   2. Every name in that file is a gate the core actually declares.
//   3. Every core `[features] default` gate is forwarded or explicitly
//      allow-listed below. Retained from the original guard.
//
// Assertion 3 used to be the whole guard, and it was sound only while `default`
// meant "everything the product ships". It does not any more: `default` is the
// CONTRIBUTOR set (what a bare `cargo check` and rust-analyzer compile) and the
// product set is larger. A subset check against a shrinking list gets weaker
// every time the list shrinks, and would pass vacuously if `default` ever
// reached zero gates — silently re-arming the exact failure described below.
// That is why assertion 1 exists and why it compares an explicit list.
//
// Why this exists (#4919): the shell declares `openhuman_core` with
// `default-features = false`, so it does NOT inherit the core's `default` list.
// Every default-ON gate must be forwarded by hand, and nothing enforced that.
// When the two drift, the domain is compiled out of the shipped desktop app and
// the failure is invisible — no build error, no failing test:
//
//   - `voice`  shipped missing from v0.58.19 to v0.61.x. Every `openhuman.voice_*`
//              RPC answered "unknown method"; 56 users, ~93k Sentry events (#4901).
//   - `tokenjuice-treesitter` was never forwarded once since #4123 and failed
//              *soft* — AST compression silently degraded to a heuristic (#4918).
//
// Two of three gates were dropped, by two different authors, one of whom knew
// about the trap and documented it in a comment. A comment is documentation,
// not enforcement.
//
// This is a deliberately narrow TOML reader rather than a general parser: it
// only needs two well-known shapes, and the repo has no TOML dependency for
// Node. It is regex/scanner-based in the same spirit as `checklist-parser.mjs`.
