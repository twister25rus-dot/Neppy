# PR CI Rust core coverage lane — changed-files-only cargo-llvm-cov.
#
# Fast-lane policy (PRs targeting main): instead of the full ~13k-test
# instrumented suite, run only the unit tests for the modules the PR touched:
#   - src/<a>/<b>/... .rs  → libtest filter "<a>::<b>" (domain-level scope, so
#     sibling-module tests like store_tests.rs / ops.rs still run)
#   - tests/<name>.rs      → that integration-test target only (--test <name>)
# On top of that, a small table (`domain_integration_targets`) drags in the
# integration targets that GUARD a domain but live outside `--lib`, so a PR
# touching only that domain's src/ still runs its gate.
# Coverage from all scoped runs is merged (--no-report + report) into a single
# lcov file; the PR CI Gate's diff-cover step enforces >= 80% on changed lines.
#
# NOTE: this means changed lines must be covered by tests in their own domain
# (or a changed integration test) — coverage contributed by unrelated suites
# no longer counts on the fast lane. The full suite still runs on main→release
# PRs (Release CI).
#
# TWO GATES GUARD THE "WE VERIFIED NOTHING" CASE (PR #5593):
#   1. scripts/ci/assert-coverage-presence.sh — hard failure when a changed
#      source file produced no lcov records at all, i.e. the lane never
#      compiled it. This is the precise one; it names the files.
#   2. A zero-executed-tests scoped run ESCALATES to the full suite rather than
#      failing. Scoping that selects no tests is unsafe scoping, and this
#      script's standing policy for unsafe scoping is to widen, not to redden —
#      a domain that legitimately owns no unit tests (there are five today,
#      e.g. core::shutdown) must not turn every PR touching it red.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   FULL          "true" → run the full suite (build-config / lib.rs / script
#                 changes, detected by paths-filter)
#   CHANGED_FILES shell-quoted, space-separated repo-relative paths from
#                 dorny/paths-filter (list-files: shell)
#   OUT           lcov output path (default lcov-core.info)
#
# Falls back to the FULL suite whenever scoping is not clearly safe.
