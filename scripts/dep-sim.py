"""Simulate the dependency-floor effect of cutting crates, without editing Cargo.toml.

Why this exists
---------------
Additive per-dependency arithmetic is systematically wrong. Asking "what does
`cargo tree -i X` show?" for each candidate and summing the answers over-counts
shared subtrees and under-counts crates that only become droppable once a
*sibling* is also cut. The original audit's ~167 projection was produced that
way and was refuted; the real post-cut number is materially different.

This walks the actual resolved graph instead: cut a set of crates, redo the
reachability walk, count what survives. Cutting a cohort tells you the truth
about the cohort.

Why it parses `cargo tree` rather than `cargo metadata`
-------------------------------------------------------
`cargo metadata`'s resolve graph is *maximal*: `resolve.nodes[].deps` lists
dependencies that the active feature set never activates, and it keeps
target-specific edges that `--filter-platform` does not prune from the node
lists. A walk over it over-reports badly — measured here at 454 names against
cargo's actual 418, wrongly including dev-dependencies (`proptest`,
`rusty-fork`), Windows/macOS TLS edges (`openssl-sys`, `native-tls`,
`hyper-tls`), and unenabled reqwest features (`quinn`, `async-compression`).

Reproducing cargo's feature resolution correctly means resolving `dep:` syntax,
weak dependencies, and feature unification per node — a reimplementation whose
bugs would be invisible. `cargo tree` has already done that work exactly, so we
use its output as the graph source. The simulator is therefore calibrated by
construction, and `--cut-nothing` proves it against `kernel-floor.sh`.

Counting convention: the root crate (`openhuman`) is included, matching
`cargo tree` and `kernel-floor.sh`, so all three agree digit-for-digit.

    Two very different questions, and confusing them inflates every projection:

    `global_cut=False` (**the default — models a Cargo feature gate**). Removes
    only the ROOT's own edges to the cut crates. A crate with another parent
    survives, because gating openhuman's dependency on it cannot remove someone
    else's. This is what "make dep X optional behind a feature" actually does.

    `global_cut=True` (`--global-cut`) removes the crate from the graph however
    it is reached. That answers "what if this crate did not exist at all", which
    is only achievable by also changing the OTHER parents — usually an upstream
    PR, not a feature flag.

    The gap between them is not academic. The `encryption` cohort measures -17
    globally but **-4** as a gate, because `hmac`/`hkdf`/`x25519-dalek` arrive via
    `tinyplace` and `zeroize` via `aws-lc-rs -> rustls -> reqwest`. Quoting the
    global number as a gate's value overstates it by a factor of four.
