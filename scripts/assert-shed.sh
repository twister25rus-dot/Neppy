# Assert that crates are absent from a profile's NORMAL dependency graph.
#
# Why not `cargo tree -i <crate>`, which the migration checklist originally
# suggested: two failure modes make it unreliable as a shed proof.
#
#   1. It EXITS NON-ZERO when the crate is absent ("did not match any
#      packages") rather than printing nothing, so a naive `if cargo tree -i`
#      inverts the result.
#   2. `-i` resolves against the whole package set, not the edge kind. A crate
#      that is gone from the normal graph but still present as a
#      dev-dependency is reported as PRESENT even with `-e normal`, because
#      `-e` filters displayed edges, not what `-i` can find. `env_logger` is
#      exactly this case after the `bin-tools` gate.
#
# This checks membership in the same normal-edge graph `kernel-floor.sh`
# counts, so a pass here means the floor metric really did drop.
#
# Usage: scripts/assert-shed.sh <profile> <crate>...
#        scripts/assert-shed.sh flows clap env_logger anstream
