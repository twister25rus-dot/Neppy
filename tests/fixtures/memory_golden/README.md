## Contents

`workspace/**.db` is a real memory workspace seeded through production write
paths and then `VACUUM`ed with `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`, so each
file is self-contained (no `-wal` / `-shm` siblings). It holds:

- documents in two namespaces (`golden-primary`, `golden-secondary`)
- both KV scopes (global and namespace)
- a graph triple
- an episodic row (which materialises the `episodic_fts` shadow tables and
  the sync triggers)
- a sealed, summarised conversation segment with both embedding tiers
- an event row (materialising `event_fts`) with a per-model embedding
- a `user_profile` facet
- a tinycortex leaf chunk with an embedding, and a summary tree sealed to an
  L1 summary node with its own embedding

`manifest.txt` is **derived from those DB files**, never written by hand.

## Why this is committed as a binary

`.gitattributes` marks `tests/fixtures/memory_golden/**/*.db binary`. Without
it the repo-wide `* text=auto eol=lf` rule would rewrite byte sequences inside
the blobs on checkout and corrupt them.

## Reviewing a change to this directory

A diff that touches this directory is a **schema-migration review**, not a
test-data refresh. Ask for the migration that carries existing user workspaces
across, and check that the manifest diff matches the DDL diff.
