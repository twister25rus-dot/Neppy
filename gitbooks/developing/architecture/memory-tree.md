# Memory Tree (`src/openhuman/memory/tree/`)

`src/openhuman/memory/tree/` is the **generic tree engine** sitting under the user-facing [Memory Tree feature](../../features/obsidian-wiki/memory-tree.md). It owns the kind-agnostic mechanics that a concrete tree uses: appending leaves, cascading bucket seals, summarising one level to the next, scoring and embedding, and retrieving for agents. It is deliberately **unaware** of which flavour a tree belongs to.

> **Removed: Global & Topic trees.** Earlier revisions also built a singleton **Global** (cross-source, time-axis: day → week → month → year) digest tree and per-entity **Topic** (subject-axis) trees. Both were derived projections over the Source trees (no original content lived only in them) and were removed in favour of "walk the Source trees + the entity index." Source-tree policy lives in `src/openhuman/memory/tree_source`; persistence (the single `Tree` table) lives one layer down in `memory_store::trees`. The `TreeKind::Global`/`Topic` enum variants survive only as inert serialization plumbing so the one-shot purge migration can read and delete legacy rows.

## Layer rules

These are load-bearing invariants. Break one and the engine stops being kind-agnostic:

- **No tree-kind branching here.** `bucket_seal`, `flush`, `registry`, and `summarise` all take `TreeKind` as a parameter or treat it as opaque. Conditionals on "is this a Source tree?" belong in the orchestrator (`src/openhuman/memory/`), not here.
- **No persistence here.** Reads and writes go through `memory_store::trees::{store, registry, hotness}`. This module does not open SQLite handles directly.
- **No policy here.** Curator gates (hotness thresholds), digest cadence, global scope sentinels all live in `memory::tree_{global,topic}`. This module reacts to policy decisions, it does not make them.

## How a write flows in

1. The orchestrator (`memory::*`) constructs a `TreeWriteRequest` with a `TreeKind` and a `TreeLeafPayload`.
2. `tree::bucket_seal` appends the leaf to the open bucket at L0. If the bucket fills, it seals: `summarise.rs` produces the L1 summary, which becomes a leaf in the L1 bucket, and the cascade continues upward until a non-full bucket is hit.
3. `score/` runs in the background: embeddings (cloud / Ollama / inert backend), entity extraction (regex first, LLM optional), hotness signals. None of this blocks the write path.
4. The outcome (`TreeWriteOutcome`) is returned synchronously to the orchestrator; scoring catches up asynchronously.

`tree::flush` exists for the time-bounded case: if a bucket hasn't filled within its TTL, it gets sealed partially so the next level always has something fresh to summarise.

## How a read flows out

Agents reach this module through the tools in `retrieval/`:

- `walk`: agentic exploration; the agent picks summary nodes to drill into.
- `drill_down`: deterministic traversal from a known starting summary.
- `fetch_leaves`: pull raw leaves for a sealed bucket.
- `query_source`: source-scoped retrieval (the only kind-scoped query left; `query_global`/`query_topic` were removed).
- `search_entities`: entity-index lookup backed by `score/`.

All retrieval handlers consult `memory_store::trees::hotness` so warm content surfaces first.

## Controller registry

`memory_tree::mod.rs` re-exports two controller registries that get wired into the global registry in `src/core/all.rs`:

- `all_memory_tree_controller_schemas` / `all_memory_tree_registered_controllers`: sourced from `memory::schema` (the orchestrator hosts them; this module just surfaces them under the `memory_tree` path).
- `all_retrieval_controller_schemas` / `all_retrieval_registered_controllers`: the agent-facing read tools listed above.
- `all_tree_summarizer_controller_schemas` / `all_tree_summarizer_registered_controllers`: from `tree_runtime`, for summariser admin / inspection.
