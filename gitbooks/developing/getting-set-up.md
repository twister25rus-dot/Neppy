# Building & Installing OpenHuman

This guide covers the full desktop/source install path and release installers.

If you only need the repo-root Rust crate on a fresh machine, use [Building the Rust Core](building-rust-core.md). That page documents the pinned Rust toolchain, OS package prerequisites, and the exact `cargo` commands for `openhuman-core`.

This guide covers two paths:

1. Build and compile OpenHuman from source
2. Install the latest stable release binaries

## Prerequisites

- `git`
- Node.js 24 or newer (see `app/package.json`)
- `pnpm@10.10.0` (see the root `package.json` `packageManager` field)
- Rust 1.93.0 through `rustup` with `rustfmt` and `clippy` (see `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- CMake, required by native Rust dependencies
- Git submodules under `app/src-tauri/vendor/`, required for the vendored CEF-aware Tauri CLI
- Platform desktop build tools: Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS, or the Tauri GTK/WebKit/AppIndicator package set on Linux

macOS Homebrew quick start:

```bash
brew install node@24 pnpm rustup-init cmake
rustup toolchain install 1.93.0 --profile minimal
rustup component add rustfmt clippy --toolchain 1.93.0
```

Arch Linux quick start:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed nodejs npm rustup cmake base-devel clang openssl \
  alsa-lib xdotool libxtst libxi libevdev gtk3 webkit2gtk-4.1 \
  libayatana-appindicator librsvg patchelf nss nspr at-spi2-core \
  libcups libdrm libxkbcommon libxcomposite libxdamage libxfixes \
  libxrandr mesa pango cairo libxshmfence
npm install -g pnpm@10.10.0
rustup toolchain install 1.93.0 --profile minimal
rustup component add rustfmt clippy --toolchain 1.93.0
```

## Build from source (local compile)

Run from the repository root:

```bash
# 1) Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman.git
cd openhuman

# 2) Fetch vendored Tauri/CEF sources
git submodule update --init --recursive

# 3) Install JS deps (workspace)
pnpm install

# 4) Build desktop app artifacts
pnpm build
```

For local development instead of production build:

```bash
# Web-only UI development
pnpm dev

# Desktop app development with the vendored Tauri/CEF CLI: run from the workspace root
pnpm --filter openhuman-app dev:app
```

## Install latest stable release (macOS/Linux x64)

Primary install command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Installer behavior:

- Resolves latest stable OpenHuman release for your platform
- Validates artifact digest when available
- Installs locally (no sudo by default)
- macOS: installs `OpenHuman.app` into `~/Applications`
- Linux x64: installs AppImage as `~/.local/bin/openhuman` and writes a desktop entry

### Arch Linux package recipe

The repository includes an `openhuman-bin` AUR recipe at
[`packages/arch/openhuman-bin`](../../packages/arch/openhuman-bin/). It uses the
official x86_64 AppImage as the binary source, extracts the bundled application
tree during `makepkg`, installs a desktop entry, and exposes `/usr/bin/openhuman`.

Until the package is published on AUR, build it locally on Arch:

```bash
cd packages/arch/openhuman-bin
makepkg --syncdeps --install
```

After publication, Arch users can install it with:

```bash
yay -S openhuman-bin
```

Useful flags:

```bash
# Preview actions without writing files
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --dry-run
```

## Windows (latest stable)

Use PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

Windows installer behavior:

- Resolves latest stable release
- Downloads MSI/EXE for x64
- Verifies digest when available
- Runs per-user install where supported by installer package

## ARM Linux Build (aarch64)

The ARM Linux build requires special handling due to CEF and GTK dependencies.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install xvfb for headless builds/testing
sudo apt install xvfb
```

### Build

```bash
cd app
pnpm tauri build --target aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

### Running the ARM binary

The binary requires the CEF library path to be set:

### Option 1 - Direct invocation

```bash
REL_DIR=app/src-tauri/target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release
CEF_DIR=$(ls -d "$REL_DIR"/build/cef-dll-sys-*/out/cef_linux_aarch64 2>/dev/null | head -n1)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$CEF_DIR:$REL_DIR/deps:$REL_DIR${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
"$REL_DIR/OpenHuman" --no-sandbox
```

### Option 2 - Wrapper script (recommended)

Save to `~/bin/openhuman` and make it executable (`chmod +x ~/bin/openhuman`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
REL_DIR=/path/to/app/src-tauri/target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release
CEF_DIR=$(ls -d "$REL_DIR"/build/cef-dll-sys-*/out/cef_linux_aarch64 2>/dev/null | head -n1)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$CEF_DIR:$REL_DIR/deps:$REL_DIR${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
exec "$REL_DIR/OpenHuman" --no-sandbox "$@"
```

### DEB package install

```bash
DEB_FILE=$(ls app/src-tauri/target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/bundle/deb/OpenHuman_*_arm64.deb | head -n1)
sudo dpkg -i "$DEB_FILE"
```

### GTK initialization fix

The ARM build requires GTK to be initialized before Tauri creates the system tray. This is handled in `vendor/tauri-cef/crates/tauri-runtime-cef/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
// After CEF initialization, add:
#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
{
    gtk::init().ok();
}
```

If the tray fails to initialize with "GTK has not been initialized", rebuild after ensuring this fix is in place.

## Troubleshooting

### macOS: `pnpm dev:app` exits with "CEF cache is held by another OpenHuman instance"

**Symptom**

`pnpm dev:app` (or any debug build of the Tauri shell) exits before the window appears with a message like:

```
[openhuman] CEF cache at /Users/<you>/Library/Caches/com.openhuman.app/cef is held by another OpenHuman instance (host <hostname>, pid 12345).
Quit the running instance and try again.
Workaround:
  pkill -f "OpenHuman.app/Contents"
  pkill -f "openhuman-core"
```

**Cause**

CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) holds an exclusive lock on its user-data directory via a `SingletonLock` symlink under `~/Library/Caches/com.openhuman.app/cef`. Both the installed `.app` bundle and the dev binary use the same identifier (`com.openhuman.app`), so they cannot run side-by-side. Without the preflight, `cef::initialize` returns failure and the vendored `tauri-runtime-cef` panics with a Rust backtrace and no actionable message (this was issue #864 before the preflight landed).

**Fix**

Quit the other OpenHuman instance and re-run. Fastest path:

```bash
pkill -f "OpenHuman.app/Contents"
pkill -f "openhuman-core"
pnpm dev:app
```

If the lock is left behind by a crashed process (PID no longer alive), the preflight removes the stale `SingletonLock` automatically and dev startup proceeds, no manual cleanup required.

**Known limitation**

Dev and release builds still share `com.openhuman.app` as the cache identifier. Isolating dev to a separate `com.openhuman.app.dev` cache requires changes to the vendored `tauri-runtime-cef` (cache path is built inside the runtime from the bundle identifier, not exposed to the openhuman shell). Tracked as a follow-up to #864.

### Stale `openhuman` RPC process on the core port

**Symptom**

A previous Tauri build or `openhuman-core run` harness left a process listening on `OPENHUMAN_CORE_PORT` (default `7788`). Until issue #1130 the new Tauri build would silently attach to that listener, leading to version drift and 401s when the new build's `OPENHUMAN_CORE_TOKEN` didn't match.

**Current behavior (issue #1130)**

`core_process::ensure_running` now probes the port at startup:

- If `GET /` identifies the listener as an OpenHuman core (JSON body with `"name": "openhuman"`), it is treated as a stale process from a previous run and proactively terminated (`SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL` after 750ms on Unix; `taskkill /F /T /PID` on Windows). The Tauri host then spawns its own fresh embedded core.
- If the listener is something else (or doesn't speak HTTP), startup fails loudly with the conflict surfaced in the log instead of silently attaching.
- Set `OPENHUMAN_CORE_REUSE_EXISTING=1` to opt back into the legacy attach-to-anything behavior, useful when running `openhuman-core run` as a manual debugging harness.

**Manual cleanup (still works)**

```bash
pkill -f "OpenHuman.app/Contents"
pkill -f "openhuman-core"
```
