# Rewards & Referrals

OpenHuman bundles three loosely related growth mechanics behind one surface: a **referral program** (share a code, earn credit when friends convert), **promo coupons** (redeem a code for promotional credit), and a **community rewards** track (link Discord, unlock roles as you hit usage milestones). Invite-code management lives on its own screen.

All of this requires a signed-in backend session. On a local-only session the Rewards page shows an empty state prompting you to sign in - none of these features work offline.

## The Rewards screen

Lives at `/rewards` with three chip tabs. The middle **Rewards** (community) tab is selected by default.

| Tab           | What it does                                                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Referrals** | Your referral code, earnings, and referred-user activity          |
| **Rewards**   | Discord connection, progress ring, and unlockable community roles |
| **Coupons**   | Redeem promo codes for promotional credit + redemption history    |

---

## Referrals

Each account has a single **referral code**. Copy it, or use **Share** (native share sheet, falling back to clipboard) to send a prefilled message with your code and the app download link.

The tab shows four tiles: your code, **total earned** (USD), **pending referrals**, and **completed** referrals. Below them, an **activity table** lists each referred user (masked identity, e.g. `j***@gmail.com`), a status badge, the reward amount, and a timestamp.

| Referral status | Meaning                                            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Joined          | Referred user signed up but hasn't converted yet   |
| Completed       | Referred user converted - referral reward credited |
| Expired         | Relationship lapsed (reserved; backend-driven)     |

If you were referred by someone else and are still eligible, an **apply** form lets you enter their code. Eligibility (`canApplyReferral`) is decided by the backend - typically only users who haven't already subscribed or already applied a code can claim one. Once applied, the form is replaced by a confirmation of the linked code.

Reward amounts, conversion rules, and eligibility are all enforced **server-side**. The desktop core is a thin adapter here.

### Under the hood

The referral domain (`src/openhuman/hosted/referral/`) is a stateless RPC adapter, not business logic. It exists because the desktop WebView `fetch` can fail with a generic "Load failed" (CORS/TLS/WebKit), so these calls reuse the same server-side `reqwest` path as billing.

| RPC                  | Backend call           | Purpose                                                               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `referral.get_stats` | `GET /referral/stats`  | Code, totals, and referred-user rows                                  |
| `referral.claim`     | `POST /referral/claim` | Apply a referral code (optional device fingerprint for abuse signals) |

Both fail closed with `no backend session token` when no session is stored.

---

## Coupons (Redeem)

The Coupons tab redeems **promo codes** for promotional credit - separate from referral rewards. Two tiles show your **promo credit balance** (USD) and the **count of redeemed codes**. Enter a code and redeem; redemption is either applied immediately or accepted as **pending** when it's conditional on a later action.

A **recent redemptions** table lists each code, its reward amount, status, and when it was redeemed.

| Coupon status  | Meaning                                         |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Applied        | Fulfilled - credit is on your account           |
| Pending action | Conditional coupon awaiting a triggering action |
| Redeemed       | Accepted, not yet fulfilled                     |

## Community rewards & Discord

The Rewards tab gamifies usage. A **progress ring** shows how many achievements you've unlocked out of the total, and a list of **roles & rewards** describes each milestone (some carry an optional USD credit). Status badges (current streak, cumulative tokens) summarize your activity at the bottom.

Rewards are delivered as **Discord roles**, so the tab is built around linking your Discord account:

1. **Connect Discord** runs an OAuth consent flow (`openhuman.auth.oauth_connect` with provider `discord`); on success the snapshot refreshes and shows your Discord username.
2. **Join Discord** opens the community server invite.
3. **Disconnect** unlinks the account (clears the stored Discord ID, idempotent).

Once linked, each unlocked achievement shows its Discord role-assignment state:

| Role status   | Meaning                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assigned      | Role granted on the server                              |
| Pending       | Unlocked but the role hasn't been assigned yet          |
| Join to claim | Linked but not in the server - join to receive the role |

If you've unlocked a role-bearing achievement but haven't joined the server, a **claim banner** prompts you to join. Membership status is one of `member`, `not_in_guild`, `not_linked`, or `unavailable`.

> GitHub-based contributor rewards are a **separate** mechanism: a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/contributor-rewards.yml`) that posts a Discord/merch invite comment when a contributor's first PR merges. It is not part of the in-app Rewards screen and uses no in-app GitHub OAuth.

## Invite codes

The **Invites** screen (`/invites`) is distinct from referral codes. It manages personal **invite codes** that gate new-user signup:

- **Redeem** - if you haven't been invited yet, enter an invite code to claim your spot.
- **Your invite codes** - a list of the codes issued to you. Each row shows the code (monospace), a copy button, and an **enabled/disabled** state. A code flips to disabled once its uses are exhausted (`currentUses >= maxUses`), and shows who claimed it.

Invite codes carry a `type` (`USER` or `CAMPAIGN`), `maxUses`/`currentUses` counters, and a `usageHistory` of who redeemed them and when.
