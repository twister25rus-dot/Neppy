# MCP Servers & Skills

The [one-click OAuth integrations](README.md) are the curated path. Beyond them, OpenHuman opens up the wider open-tooling ecosystem in two ways: the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** registry and the **Skills** catalog. OpenHuman can also expose _itself_ as an MCP server to other clients.

---

## MCP servers (thousands)

OpenHuman has a built-in **MCP registry** that browses the open MCP ecosystem and lets you install servers locally as new typed tools for the agent.

- **Two upstream registries, merged.** Discovery fans out in parallel to [Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai) and the official [`registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io), then merges the results: thousands of servers across both.
- **Search → install → connect.** Search the catalog, view a server's details, and install it. A local install spawns the server as a stdio subprocess; deployed servers connect over HTTP.
- **Supervised connections.** Installed servers are persisted in a local SQLite store (`mcp_clients/mcp_clients.db`) with their command, args, and transport. A supervisor loop keeps enabled servers connected, probing every ~60s with per-server exponential backoff.

Once connected, an MCP server's tools are available to the agent exactly like native tools.

> The catalogs are open-ended and grow on their own. The "5,000+" figure reflects the combined Smithery + official ecosystem size, not a fixed list baked into OpenHuman.

### OpenHuman as an MCP server

OpenHuman can run the other way around, too. `openhuman-core mcp` exposes OpenHuman over stdio as an MCP server, offering read-only tools (memory search / recall, Memory Tree browsing, and optional web search) to clients like Claude Desktop. See [MCP Server](../../developing/mcp-server.md) for setup.

## Skills (90,000-entry catalog)

**Skills** are a large, browsable catalog of agent skills (`SKILL.md`-style capability bundles) aggregated from multiple upstream sources (HermesHub, ClawHub, LobeHub, and more).

- **One aggregated catalog.** Sourced from HermesHub (configurable via `OPENHUMAN_SKILL_REGISTRY_CATALOG_URL`), the catalog runs to roughly **90,000 entries**. Each entry carries id, name, description, source, author, version, tags, platforms, a download URL, and license.
- **Cached and fast.** The catalog is fetched on boot in the background (without blocking startup), cached locally at `~/.openhuman/skill-registry/cache.json` with a ~1-hour TTL and served stale-while-revalidate. A single-flight gate prevents duplicate downloads of the large catalog.
- **Metadata-first.** OpenHuman's in-app skills runtime (the old QuickJS sandbox) has been **removed**. Skills are now a metadata catalog you browse and install from the **Connections → Skills** tab, not code executing inside the app. Availability varies per entry: some expose a direct `SKILL.md` download, others point to external hosting.
