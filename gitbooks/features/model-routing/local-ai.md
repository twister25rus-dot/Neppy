# Local AI (optional)

OpenHuman can run a local model on your machine for workloads where keeping data on-device matters: **memory embeddings, summary-tree building, background reasoning loops, and explicitly routed chat or reasoning workloads**. It is **opt-in** and ships **off** by default.

This is deliberate scoping. The previous design tried to put every modality on-device by default, and the result was a heavy, hardware-sensitive footprint. Today, local AI stays explicit: recurring privacy-sensitive work can run locally, and chat/reasoning can also run locally when you route those workloads to a local provider.

## What runs local when you turn it on

| Workload                  | Default model                     | Implementation                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Memory embeddings**     | `bge-m3`                          | `src/openhuman/inference/embeddings/ollama.rs` - used by the [Memory Tree](../obsidian-wiki/memory-tree.md) for vector search. |
| **Summary-tree building** | `gemma3:1b-it-qat` (configurable) | `src/openhuman/tree_summarizer/ops.rs` - source / topic / global summary builders for the Memory Tree.                         |
| **Heartbeat loop**        | small chat model                  | `src/openhuman/subconscious/heartbeat/` - periodic background reflection.                                                      |
| **Learning / reflection** | small chat model                  | `src/openhuman/agent/learning/reflection.rs` - passes that consolidate what was learned.                                       |
| **Subconscious**          | small chat model                  | `src/openhuman/subconscious/executor.rs` - background evaluation loop.                                                         |
| **Chat**                  | configured local chat model       | `Config::workload_local_model("chat")` reads `chat_provider`; `src/openhuman/routing/provider.rs` handles hint routing.        |
| **Reasoning**             | configured local chat model       | `Config::workload_local_model("reasoning")` reads `reasoning_provider`; see [Opting in](#opting-in).                           |

Each of these is an explicit opt-in. Turning on local AI does not silently route everything through it, you choose the workloads.

## What stays in the cloud by default

| Workload       | Why cloud                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chat**       | Frontier reasoning quality unless `chat_provider` is explicitly set to a local provider.       |
| **Reasoning**  | Stronger multi-step quality unless `reasoning_provider` is explicitly set to a local provider. |
| **Vision**     | Same, unless `vision_provider` points at a local vision-capable model. See below.              |
| **STT**        | Backend-proxied transcription (`src/openhuman/voice/cloud_transcribe.rs`).                     |
| **TTS**        | Hosted [text-to-speech](../native-tools/voice.md) under the hood (`reply_speech.rs`).          |
| **Web search** | Backend proxy (no API key on your machine).                                                    |

For **lightweight or medium chat hints** (`hint:reaction`, `hint:classify`, `hint:format`, `hint:sentiment`, `hint:summarize`, `hint:medium`, `hint:tool_lite`), the [router](README.md) can prefer the local provider only when `local_ai.runtime_enabled = true` and the configured local provider is reachable.

Heavy hints (`hint:reasoning`, `hint:agentic`, `hint:coding`) stay cloud by default unless the matching workload provider field is explicitly configured locally.

## How it works

Under the hood, OpenHuman supports two local provider paths:

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com), used for bundled model lifecycle, embeddings, and the existing model-asset flow.
- [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai), used through its local OpenAI-compatible server for chat-style local inference.

For Ollama, OpenHuman talks to its OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint where possible. That means:

- The `OpenAiCompatibleProvider` (`src/openhuman/providers/compatible.rs`) wraps Ollama exactly the way it wraps a remote OpenAI-style provider. No special-case code path.
- The provider router creates a _health-gated_ local provider on startup. If Ollama is not reachable, requests transparently fall back to the remote provider, no broken state.
- Models are pulled on demand by Ollama and cached in its own store. OpenHuman doesn't ship the weights itself.

For LM Studio, set `local_ai.provider = "lm_studio"` and ensure LM Studio's local server is running. OpenHuman defaults to `http://localhost:1234/v1`, probes `GET /v1/models`, and sends chat requests to `POST /v1/chat/completions`. You can override the endpoint with `local_ai.base_url`, `OPENHUMAN_LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL`, or `LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL`.

## Opting in

Local runtime startup is gated in the core config (`src/openhuman/config/schema/local_ai.rs`):

| Flag                                 | Default  | Meaning                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `local_ai.runtime_enabled`           | `false`  | Master switch. `false` ⇒ no local provider is created at all.            |
| `local_ai.opt_in_confirmed`          | `false`  | Explicit opt-in marker. Bootstrap forces `false` unless you re-opt.      |
| `local_ai.provider`                  | `ollama` | Local provider: `ollama` or `lm_studio`.                                 |
| `local_ai.base_url`                  | unset    | Optional provider URL. LM Studio defaults to `http://localhost:1234/v1`. |
| `local_ai.usage.embeddings`          | `false`  | Legacy preset/migration flag for memory embeddings.                      |
| `local_ai.usage.heartbeat`           | `false`  | Legacy preset/migration flag for the heartbeat loop.                     |
| `local_ai.usage.learning_reflection` | `false`  | Legacy preset/migration flag for learning passes.                        |
| `local_ai.usage.subconscious`        | `false`  | Legacy preset/migration flag for the subconscious loop.                  |

Unified workload provider fields control chat/reasoning routing. Set them to an Ollama provider string when you want those paths on-device:

```toml
chat_provider = "ollama:llama3.1:8b"
reasoning_provider = "ollama:qwen2.5:14b"
```

On current configs, the `*_provider` fields are the source of truth for workload routing (`Config::workload_local_model(...)` in `src/openhuman/config/schema/types.rs`). Unset, blank, `cloud`, `openhuman`, or any non-`ollama:` value keeps that workload on the cloud/default route. Setting a provider string such as `ollama:all-minilm:latest` or `ollama:qwen2.5:14b` routes that workload on-device when `local_ai.runtime_enabled = true` and the provider health check passes.

The legacy `local_ai.usage.*` booleans are kept for presets and migration compatibility; they do not override the unified provider fields after migration. For deterministic routing, either set the workload provider field explicitly, or leave it unset / set it to `cloud` to force the default cloud route. The same provider-string pattern is used by `agentic_provider`, `coding_provider`, `memory_provider`, `embeddings_provider`, `heartbeat_provider`, `learning_provider`, and `subconscious_provider`.

### Legacy flag behavior

The `local_ai.usage.*` booleans are consulted only during preset application and initial migration. After that, `Config::workload_local_model(...)` treats the matching `*_provider` field as the definitive routing control:

- `embeddings_provider = "ollama:all-minilm"` routes embeddings on-device even if `local_ai.usage.embeddings = false`.
- An unset, blank, or `cloud` `embeddings_provider` keeps embeddings on the cloud/default route even if `local_ai.usage.embeddings = true`.

Prefer setting the `*_provider` fields directly when editing configuration by hand.

In the desktop app, **Settings → AI & Skills → Local AI** exposes presets, pick one ("embeddings only", "memory + reflection", "everything local") and the right combination of flags is set for you. Status (Ollama reachability, model availability, per-subsystem enablement) is surfaced live via `openhuman.inference_status`.

## When to turn it on

Local AI is worth turning on if any of these are true:

- Keep embeddings local when ingesting large volumes of email / chat.
- Enable **summary-tree building** to work offline.
- Keep background reflection ("subconscious") loops on-device for privacy-sensitive work.

It is **not** worth turning on if you only have a few sources connected, the cloud path is faster and the privacy benefit is small. There is also a hardware cost: Ollama and a small Gemma model want a few GB of RAM and pull a few GB of weights.

## Local vision

Vision is a separate capability from chat, and **most small local models cannot do it**. Ollama does not reject an image sent to a text-only model: it drops the image and answers from the prompt text, which produces a fluent description of something the model never saw. OpenHuman therefore resolves the vision model through a capability check and refuses to route a vision request at a chat-only model.

What that means in practice:

- `local_ai.vision_model_id` must name a vision-capable model. `moondream:1.8b-v2-q4_K_S` (~1.7 GB) is the smallest option; `gemma3:4b-it-qat` and `gemma4:e4b-it-q8_0` handle chat and vision with one set of weights.
- Gemma 3 is text-only at 270M and 1B, and multimodal from 4B up. **Gemma 3n is a different model and is text-only at every size**, so it is not usable for vision even though it is a capable chat model.
- Leaving `vision_model_id` empty is a valid "no local vision" setup. A vision request then returns a message naming the config key to set and the models to pull, rather than failing silently.
- If a configured vision model turns out to be chat-only, the core logs a warning and falls back to a vision-capable default instead of sending images to a model that would ignore them.

The full per-model capability table lives in [Local models & bring your own key](local-and-byok-models.md).

## What you'll need

- [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com) installed and running locally, or [**LM Studio**](https://lmstudio.ai) with the local server enabled.
- Enough disk for the models (`gemma3:1b-it-qat` \~1.0 GB, `bge-m3` \~1.2 GB, plus \~1.7 GB if you add Moondream for vision).
- Enough RAM to keep the model resident (8 GB+ recommended, 16 GB+ ideal).

OpenHuman handles the rest: lifecycle (`src/openhuman/inference/local/service/`), API clients, health checks, and graceful fallback to remote when the local provider disappears.

### LM Studio troubleshooting

- Confirm the LM Studio local server is enabled and reachable at `http://localhost:1234/v1`.
- Load the selected model in LM Studio before calling OpenHuman. Diagnostics report `load_lm_studio_model` when the configured `local_ai.chat_model_id` is not present in `/v1/models`.
- If LM Studio uses a different port, set `local_ai.base_url` or `OPENHUMAN_LM_STUDIO_BASE_URL`.
- LM Studio model downloads are managed inside LM Studio. OpenHuman will not pull LM Studio models from the local asset-download controls.
