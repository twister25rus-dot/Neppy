# Browser & Computer Control

When the agent needs to _use_ your machine the way a person would - open a page, inspect its DOM snapshot, click a button, type a phrase - these tools are how it does it.

## Browser

- **Open** a URL in an embedded webview the agent can read back from.
- **Snapshot** the current page's accessibility/DOM structure, including stable element references for later actions.

The browser surface runs through CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework) and includes a security layer that scopes what pages can do. See [Chromium Embedded Framework](../../developing/cef.md) for the platform details.

## Computer (mouse + keyboard)

- **Mouse** - move, click, drag.
- **Keyboard** - type text, send key chords.
- **Human path** - moves and clicks follow human-like trajectories rather than teleporting, so they don't trip naive bot detection.

## What it's good for

- Driving sites that don't have an API or a [native integration](../integrations/README.md).
- Multi-step UI flows where an interactive DOM snapshot provides the next actionable element.
- Automating local apps from inside a chat.
