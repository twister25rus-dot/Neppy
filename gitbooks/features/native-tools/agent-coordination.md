# Agent Coordination

Beyond doing the work, the agent has tools for _organising_ the work - planning multi-step jobs, delegating to specialists, spawning subagents, and pausing to ask the user when something is genuinely ambiguous.

## Tools in the family

| Tool                                              | What it does                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `todo_write`                                      | Maintain a structured TODO list across a long task. Marked done as work progresses.                             |
| `spawn_subagent`                                  | Delegate to a reusable async specialist by default; creates a fresh worker only when incompatible or requested. |
| `spawn_async_subagent`                            | Lower-level reusable async delegation surface with the same durable session identity.                           |
| `steer_subagent` / `wait_subagent`                | Message or collect a running worker by durable `subagent_session_id` or transient `task_id`.                    |
| `list_subagents` / `close_subagent`               | Inspect reusable workers for the parent thread or explicitly retire one.                                        |
| `spawn_worker_thread`                             | Explicit background work tracked as a separate worker thread.                                                   |
| `delegate`                                        | Hand a task to a specialist (e.g. an archetype with different prompts/tools/permissions).                       |
| `archetype_delegation`                            | Route to a named archetype - coder, researcher, planner, etc.                                                   |
| `skill_delegation`                                | Hand off to a [skill](../integrations/README.md#skills) installed in the workspace.                             |
| `ask_clarification`                               | Pause and ask the user a precise question instead of guessing.                                                  |
| `plan_exit`                                       | Exit a planning phase and start executing.                                                                      |
| `check_onboarding_status` / `complete_onboarding` | Gate behaviour on whether the user has finished onboarding.                                                     |

`spawn_subagent` and archetype delegation calls accept an optional `model` field for a one-off exact model pin. If it is omitted, the harness uses config-level per-agent pins when present and otherwise falls back to the normal model-routing hints. Model, toolkit, sandbox mode, parent thread, action root, and task key are part of reusable sub-agent compatibility, so materially different work gets a separate worker.

Reusable delegation returns both a transient `task_id` and a durable `subagent_session_id`. Prefer the durable id for cross-turn follow-ups. Pass `fresh: true` only when the user or task needs a clean worker; pass `blocking: true` only when the parent must wait inline for the child result.

## Why these are tools, not implicit behaviour

Long tasks fall apart when the agent tries to keep everything in one head. Splitting work via TODOs and subagents means:

- Each subagent keeps useful local context for the same logical job instead of being respawned every turn.
- The main thread keeps a high-level view of progress.
- Failures in one branch don't poison the rest.

Asking for clarification is a tool too, on purpose: it makes "I should ask the user" a _visible_ decision the agent can be steered toward, not an emergent behaviour.
