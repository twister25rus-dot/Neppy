# Native Tools

OpenHuman's agent doesn't ship empty. Every model behind the agent has a curated set of tools available the moment you install - no plugin marketplace, no API keys to wire up, no MCP servers to register. The whole toolbelt is in the box.

This page is the index. Each subpage covers one family of tools.

## Why ship them natively

A plugin-only model means tools live in different processes, behind RPC, with their own auth and packaging stories. That's fine for open-ended extensibility, but for the **core** tools every agent needs (read a file, search the web, edit code, set a reminder, join a meeting), shipping them in-process means:

- Consistent error handling.
- Zero install friction.
- All output passes through [Smart Token Compression](../token-compression.md) for free.
- Predictable security boundary - filesystem tools respect workspace scoping, and network tools use the managed OpenHuman proxy by default unless you opt into a self-hosted path such as SearXNG.
