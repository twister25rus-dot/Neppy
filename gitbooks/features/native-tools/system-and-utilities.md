# System & Utilities

The catch-all family. Small, sharp tools the agent reaches for to round out a task.

## Tools in the family

| Tool                | What it does                                                                |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `shell`             | Run a shell command. Bounded output, captured exit code.                    |
| `node_exec`         | Run a Node.js snippet - useful for one-off scripting.                       |
| `npm_exec`          | Run an `npm`/`pnpm`/`yarn` script.                                          |
| `python_exec`       | Run a Python 3 snippet or `.py` script - one-off scripting in Python.       |
| `current_time`      | Get the current time in any timezone, with formatting options.              |
| `schedule`          | One-shot "do this once at time T" - for recurring jobs see [Cron](cron.md). |
| `pushover`          | Send a push notification to your devices.                                   |
| `insert_sql_record` | Append a row to the agent's structured workspace SQL store.                 |
| `lsp`               | Query a language server (definitions, references, diagnostics).             |
| `workspace_state`   | Inspect the current workspace - open files, recent edits, environment.      |
| `proxy_config`      | Read or change proxy configuration for outbound requests.                   |
| `tool_stats`        | Self-reflection - what tools have been used in this session and how often.  |

## What it's good for

- The bits of a workflow that don't fit a richer tool family.
- "Just run this command and tell me what it printed."
- Time-aware behaviour ("what time is it for the user right now?") without baking timezone assumptions into prompts.
- Letting the agent _notify you_ when it's done with a long-running job.
