# agentmemory backend

OpenHuman's default `Memory` trait backend is `sqlite`, the unified store
documented in [Memory Trees](memory-tree.md). Some users already
self-host [agentmemory](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory), typically
because they want a single durable memory shared across Claude Code,
Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, and OpenHuman. For them, OpenHuman exposes an opt-in
backend that proxies every trait call through agentmemory's REST surface.

Selecting `backend = "agentmemory"` skips OpenHuman's SQLite + embedder
path entirely. agentmemory owns the storage, embedding, and retrieval
layers. OpenHuman becomes a thin REST client.

## When to use this

Use the agentmemory backend if:

- You already run `npx -y @agentmemory/agentmemory` for one or more
  coding agents and want OpenHuman to share the same durable store.
- You want hybrid BM25 + vector + graph retrieval without provisioning a
  separate embedder on the OpenHuman side.
- You prefer agentmemory's lifecycle (consolidation, retention scoring,
  auto-forget, graph extraction) over OpenHuman's unified store.

Keep the default `sqlite` backend if:

- You want self-contained, single-process operation with no external
  daemon dependency.
- You rely on OpenHuman-specific Memory Tree features (chunking,
  sealing, summary trees) that operate on top of the SQLite store. The
  Memory Tree pipeline is unaffected by the trait backend, since it
  operates on the host's document store independently. Even so, the
  agentmemory backend is most valuable when you've already standardised
  on agentmemory across other agents.

## Quick start

1. **Install + start agentmemory** (one terminal):

   ```bash
   npx -y @agentmemory/agentmemory
   ```

   Defaults to `http://localhost:3111` (REST) + `ws://localhost:49134`
   (engine). First boot generates an HMAC secret at `~/.agentmemory/.hmac`
   and prints it once.

2. **Point OpenHuman at it** in your `config.toml`:

   ```toml
   [memory]
   backend = "agentmemory"
   # Defaults below — set only when overriding.
   # agentmemory_url        = "http://localhost:3111"
   # agentmemory_secret     = ""           # HMAC bearer token, optional
   # agentmemory_timeout_ms = 5000
   ```

3. **Restart OpenHuman**. The factory short-circuits the SQLite path
   and logs `[memory::factory] using agentmemory backend at <url>`.

That's it. Existing OpenHuman call sites (`store`, `recall`, `get`,
`list`, `forget`, `namespace_summaries`, `count`, `health_check`) work
unchanged.

## Config keys

| Field                    | Default                 | Purpose                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agentmemory_url`        | `http://localhost:3111` | Base URL for the agentmemory REST server                             |
| `agentmemory_secret`     | _none_                  | Optional HMAC bearer token. Sent as `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` |
| `agentmemory_timeout_ms` | `5000`                  | Per-request reqwest timeout                                          |

When `backend == "agentmemory"`, the following existing `MemoryConfig`
fields are **ignored**, because agentmemory owns its own embedding stack
via `~/.agentmemory/.env`:

- `embedding_provider`
- `embedding_model`
- `embedding_dimensions`
- `sqlite_open_timeout_secs`

Setting them on this path is a no-op. The local-AI Ollama health-gate
also doesn't run on this path, because agentmemory's daemon manages its
own embedder lifecycle.

## Field mapping

OpenHuman's `MemoryEntry` ↔ agentmemory wire row:

| OpenHuman field            | agentmemory field                | Notes                                                             |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `namespace`                | `project`                        | Defaults to `"default"` when empty                                |
| `key`                      | `title`                          |                                                                   |
| `content`                  | `content`                        |                                                                   |
| `id`                       | `id`                             | agentmemory-generated (`mem_<rand>`)                              |
| `category: Core`           | `type: "fact"`                   |                                                                   |
| `category: Daily`          | `type: "conversation"`           |                                                                   |
| `category: Conversation`   | `type: "conversation"`           |                                                                   |
| `category: Custom(s)`      | `type: "fact"` + `concepts: [s]` | Custom tag rolled into the concepts array so it remains queryable |
| `session_id`               | `sessionIds: [...]`              | OpenHuman exposes a single id; agentmemory persists an array      |
| `timestamp`                | `updatedAt` (RFC3339)            | Falls back to `createdAt` if `updatedAt` is absent                |
| `score` (recall hits only) | smart-search `score`             | Populated on `recall` responses, `None` on `get` / `list`         |

agentmemory carries additional fields that this backend leaves at
defaults: `concepts` (auto-extracted), `files` (path tags), `strength`
(retention score), `version`, and `supersedes` (the lifecycle chain).
They're internal to agentmemory's lifecycle layer and don't need to
round-trip through OpenHuman's trait.

## Trait method → endpoint

| `Memory` method       | agentmemory REST                                     | Notes                                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `store`               | `POST /agentmemory/remember`                         | `{project, title, content, type, concepts, sessionIds}` |
| `recall`              | `POST /agentmemory/smart-search`                     | Hybrid BM25 + vector + graph                            |
| `get`                 | `POST /agentmemory/smart-search`                     | + client-side exact-title filter                        |
| `list`                | `GET /agentmemory/memories?latest=true&project=<ns>` |                                                         |
| `forget`              | `get(ns, key)` → `POST /agentmemory/forget`          | Two-step: resolve id then forget                        |
| `namespace_summaries` | `GET /agentmemory/projects`                          | Returns `[{name, count, lastUpdated}]`                  |
| `count`               | `GET /agentmemory/health`                            | Reads `memories` field                                  |
| `health_check`        | `GET /agentmemory/livez`                             |                                                         |

`RecallOpts.category`, `RecallOpts.session_id`, and `RecallOpts.min_score`
are applied as **client-side filters** on the smart-search response.
agentmemory's REST surface doesn't expose them as server-side filters
today. For very large recall windows (limit > 100) prefer issuing a
tighter query string to reduce server-side work over relying on
client-side post-filtering.

## Security

When `agentmemory_secret` is set, the client honours agentmemory's
v0.9.12 plaintext-bearer guard contract:

- **Loopback hosts** (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) over `http://`
  are allowed. This is the local dev path.
- **`https://`** to any host is allowed.
- **Plaintext HTTP to a non-loopback host** emits a one-time stderr
  warning at construction time. The bearer is observable on the wire.
- **`AGENTMEMORY_REQUIRE_HTTPS=1`** (process env, ASCII-case-insensitive
  matches `1` or `true`) escalates the warning into a hard refusal at
  client construction. The backend fails to start rather than leak the
  bearer once.

Production deploys should set `AGENTMEMORY_REQUIRE_HTTPS=1` so a
misconfigured TLS terminator fails loud rather than silently leaking.

The plaintext-bearer guard mirrors the integration plugin guards in
agentmemory's [PR #315](https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory/pull/315)
so an operator who's seen the warning on Hermes / OpenClaw / pi will
recognise the same message on OpenHuman.

## Failure modes

**No automatic fallback to SQLite.** If the daemon is down at boot, the
backend surfaces the transport error loudly. Operators flip back to
`backend = "sqlite"` in `config.toml` to recover. Rationale: a silent
SQLite fallback would hide a misconfigured daemon, and "private, simple,
predictable" wins over "magically tolerant".

## Performance notes

The backend is a thin REST proxy: it adds one HTTP round-trip per
trait call. Practical implications:

- `store` and `forget` are single-RTT.
- `recall`, `get`, `list` are single-RTT.
- `forget` against an unknown key is two-RTT (the implicit `get` lookup
  - a no-op confirmation). Caller can short-circuit this by checking
    the return value of a prior `list`.
- agentmemory's REST is `127.0.0.1` by default, so same-host latency is
  sub-millisecond. Over a managed deploy with HTTPS termination, expect
  roughly 10 to 30ms per RTT.
- The default per-request timeout is 5 seconds. Bump
  `agentmemory_timeout_ms` if you're seeing intermittent timeouts on
  cold-start of the iii engine; agentmemory's first-request latency
  after a long idle can stretch toward 3 to 5s depending on persistence
  state.

## Migration: from SQLite to agentmemory

There's no in-place migration today. The recommended path:

1. Export your existing memories from the SQLite store via OpenHuman's
   existing export RPC (or by direct SQL).
2. Walk the export and POST each row to `/agentmemory/remember` with
   the same `project` + `title` + `content`. agentmemory will assign
   new ids; the OpenHuman side picks them up on first `list`.
3. Set `backend = "agentmemory"` and restart.

A dedicated bulk import path is filed as a follow-up.
