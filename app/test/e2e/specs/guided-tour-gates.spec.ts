/**
 * E2E spec: Interactive guided tour — gates and resume behaviour (#1215).
 *
 * Three scenarios are exercised:
 *
 *   1. Skills gate: start tour, reach the skills step, confirm skills UI is
 *      present. The tooltip advances via Next — the current implementation
 *      navigates to /connections (was /skills) and highlights the grid via a `before` async hook
 *      in walkthroughSteps.ts. The test polls for the hash change rather than
 *      reading it immediately, because the Joyride `before` hook is awaited
 *      asynchronously and the hash may lag by a render cycle.
 *      Skill-connection gating is NOT implemented; that assertion is skipped
 *      and the gap is called out explicitly (GP-1).
 *
 *   2. Chat gate: the final (9th) step has a `before` hook that creates a
 *      thread and seeds a welcome message, then navigates to /chat. Reaching
 *      step 9 by clicking Next 8 times is inherently fragile in CI (any one
 *      before-hook timeout aborts the sequence). The multi-step-advance test
 *      is therefore skipped (GP-3: no shortcut to jump to an arbitrary step),
 *      and replaced by two fast, independent assertions:
 *        a) The data-walkthrough="chat-agent-panel" target exists on /chat.
 *        b) The Skip button is absent on the last Joyride step (verified by
 *           WalkthroughTooltip rendering `!isLastStep && <skip>` — tested by
 *           unit tests, not duplicated here).
 *      Sending-a-message gating is NOT implemented; skipped with GP-1 comment.
 *
 *   3. Resume after reload: set walkthrough pending flag, reload the renderer
 *      without clearing localStorage, and assert the tour auto-starts. The
 *      AppWalkthrough component reads `isWalkthroughPending()` on mount and
 *      sets `run=true`, so the tooltip should appear after reload. True
 *      mid-step resume (restoring last step index) is NOT implemented; that
 *      assertion is skipped and documented as GP-2.
 *
 * Product gaps surfaced (skipped):
 *   - GP-1: No skill-connection gate on the /connections tour step (Phase 2: was /skills).
 *   - GP-2: No step-index persistence — tour always restarts from step 0
 *           on reload rather than resuming at the last incomplete step.
 *   - GP-3: No API to jump to an arbitrary Joyride step — the only way to
 *           reach step N is to click Next N-1 times, which is fragile in CI.
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *   - The walkthrough is driven by manipulating localStorage keys directly
 *     (`openhuman:walkthrough_pending`, `openhuman:walkthrough_completed`)
 *     rather than walking the full onboarding flow, because (a) resetApp
 *     already handles onboarding and (b) the Joyride component reads these
 *     keys on mount.
 *   - `data-walkthrough` attributes are queried to verify step targets are
 *     present without coupling to tooltip text that may be i18n-translated.
 *   - The spec uses `supportsExecuteScript()` guards so it degrades
 *     gracefully on Appium Mac2 (where `browser.execute` is unavailable in
 *     a WKWebView context).
