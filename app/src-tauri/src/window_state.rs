//! Persistence of main-window position + size across restarts.
//!
//! `app.restart()` (used by #900's identity-flip flow) spawns a fresh
//! process, so the new window doesn't inherit anything from the old one.
//! Without us re-applying state, every login-driven respawn snaps the
//! window back to the default initial size in the center of the primary
//! display — even when the user had it on an external monitor or had
//! resized it.
//!
//! This module persists a tiny TOML record at
//! `<openhuman_dir>/window_state.toml` capturing the outer position and
//! outer size of the main window in physical pixels. On launch the
//! record is read and applied before the window is shown. On restart we
//! save first, hide the window, then call `app.restart()`.
//!
//! Saved state is best-effort: read errors, missing file, off-screen
//! positions, and non-existent monitors all fall back to the default
//! centered window so we never trap the window where the user can't
//! reach it.
//!
//! Window geometry — both restored saved state and the default initial
//! size from `tauri.conf.json` — is always clamped to the active
//! monitor's **work area** (the screen minus OS chrome: macOS menu
//! bar + dock, Windows taskbar, Linux panels). This prevents the window
//! from opening taller than the screen and hiding the bottom navigation
//! on small or scaled displays — see issue #2282. We also re-clamp on
//! restore so a window saved on a large external display does not come
//! back oversized after the user undocks onto a small laptop screen.
//!
//! ## Mixed-DPI multi-monitor (#5041)
//!
//! Every coordinate in this module is a **physical** pixel:
//! `Monitor::work_area()`, `outer_position()` and `outer_size()` all
//! speak physical, so there is no logical/physical conversion to get
//! wrong. The DPI hazard is elsewhere — Windows preserves a window's
//! *logical* size across a monitor change, so moving a window from a
//! 100 % display to a 150 % one makes the OS multiply its physical size
//! by 1.5 on arrival. A size that was correctly clamped to the
//! destination monitor before the move therefore arrives 1.5x too large.
//!
//! Two mitigations, because the OS rescale is asynchronous:
//!
//! 1. [`center_main`] targets the monitor the window is *already* on
//!    (avoiding the cross-DPI move entirely), and when a move is
//!    unavoidable it positions **before** sizing so the rescale lands
//!    first and the applied size is measured against the destination.
//! 2. [`install_dpi_guard`] re-clamps on `ScaleFactorChanged`, which is
//!    delivered through the message loop *after* `setup()` has returned
//!    — the case no amount of startup clamping can catch.
