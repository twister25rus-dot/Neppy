 * Transparent macOS window-drag band for the overlay title bar.
 *
 * The main window runs with `titleBarStyle: "Overlay"` + `hiddenTitle` (see
 * `app/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`), so macOS draws transparent traffic lights
 * over the web content but does NOT make the top draggable on its own — the
 * webview captures the pointer events. We opt back in with a `data-tauri-drag-
 * region` band.
 *
 * Positioned over the top of the content column ({@link RootShellLayout}), so
 * it does not reserve vertical space or add an inherited top inset to routed
 * pages. The window controls overlay this same title-bar region.
 *
 * Native CEF provider webviews composite above all HTML and so can't be dragged
 * through; that's a platform limit, not this band. The sidebar is intentionally
 * excluded — its header already drags in place.
 *
 * macOS-only: Windows/Linux keep their native decorated title bar (the
 * `Overlay` style is a no-op there), so reserving a band would only waste
 * vertical space. Outside the Tauri runtime (browser/iOS) there is no window to
 * drag, so it renders nothing.
