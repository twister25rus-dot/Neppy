/**
 * WorkflowCopilotPanel (Phase 5c) — a side-panel chat bound to the
 * `workflow_builder` specialist, docked on the editable canvas. The user asks
 * for changes ("add a Slack notification on failure", "make the schedule
 * weekdays only"); each turn injects the CURRENT draft graph as context and the
 * agent returns a `revise_workflow` proposal (and can now discover + connect the
 * Composio apps a step needs). The panel renders the full conversation
 * transcript, surfaces each proposal's node-level diff, and hands Accept/Reject
 * up to the host, which applies it to the local draft overlay.
 *
 * Chat UI parity: the copilot renders its transcript through the SAME
 * {@link ChatThreadView} the home composer chat uses — message bubbles,
 * past-turn insights, the shared tool timeline + sub-agent drawer, and the
 * streaming / interrupted / parallel previews — driven by this copilot's
 * DEDICATED thread. `flows_build` streams the `workflow_builder` turn onto
 * that thread via the global `ChatRuntimeProvider` (Phase B), exactly as a
 * normal chat turn streams, so the copilot reads like the real chat rather
 * than a bespoke transcript. This panel keeps only the authoring concerns:
 * the {@link ChatComposer} footer (mic/attachments off), the seed auto-sends,
 * and the proposal-preview + capped cards pinned above the composer.
 *
 * Invariant: the copilot only PROPOSES — the agent turn itself never
 * persists. Accept applies the proposal to the local draft AND immediately
 * saves it (review + save in one click) via the host's `onAccept`, which
 * awaits the host's own persistence call; the panel shows a saving state
 * meanwhile and, if the save fails, leaves the proposal visible for retry
 * rather than silently discarding it. Reject remains local-only (revert the
 * overlay, no persistence call).
