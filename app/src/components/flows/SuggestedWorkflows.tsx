/**
 * SuggestedWorkflows — the "Suggested for you" section on the Flows page.
 *
 * Surfaces the read-only Flow Scout's workflow suggestions as friendly cards.
 * A "Discover" button runs the `flow_discovery` agent
 * (`openhuman.flows_discover`), which reasons over the user's
 * memory/threads/connections/existing flows and records concrete, buildable
 * suggestions. Each card shows the pitch (title, one-liner, rationale) plus two
 * actions:
 *
 *   - "Build this" creates a new blank flow (named from the suggestion's
 *     title, mirroring {@link WorkflowPromptBar}'s instant-create path), then
 *     navigates into the new flow's canvas with the suggestion's
 *     `build_prompt` PRE-FILLED into the copilot's input
 *     (`location.state.copilotPrefill`, carrying `mode: 'build'` so the
 *     first Send drives a full build → dry-run → propose turn against the
 *     just-created flow) — never auto-sent. The user reviews/edits the brief
 *     and presses Send themselves. The card is dropped from THIS session's
 *     local list right away (`removeSuggestion`), but `markSuggestionBuilt`
 *     is deliberately NOT called here: that RPC's contract is "the user
 *     SAVED a flow authored from this suggestion", and this path only
 *     creates a blank flow + an unsent prompt — the user may close the
 *     canvas, never press Send, reject the proposal, or navigate away
 *     without saving. There's no clean hook back from the canvas's Save to
 *     this suggestion id yet, so we leave it un-built server-side rather
 *     than risk permanently hiding an abandoned build from Flow Scout; it
 *     can simply resurface on a later discovery run.
 *   - "Dismiss" marks the suggestion `dismissed` (kept server-side so a later
 *     discovery run won't re-surface it).
 *
 * Nothing here persists or enables a flow directly beyond the blank-flow
 * create itself — the copilot only proposes, and the canvas's explicit Save
 * is the only thing that ever persists a built graph.
