/**
 * Deterministic member → colour mapping for the agent-team surface (#3374).
 *
 * A team member should read as the *same* colour everywhere it appears — the
 * owner left-border on a task card, the roster chip in the header, and the
 * avatar in the activity rail. Tailwind can't express a per-member dynamic
 * class (the class names aren't known at build time, so they'd be purged), so
 * the colour is resolved to a house-palette hex here and applied via inline
 * style at the call site — the same approach `memory-workspace.css` already
 * uses for the primary accent.
 *
 * The palette is drawn from the project's semantic tokens (primary / sage / amber
 * / coral / sky / lavender) so the board never introduces an off-brand hue.
 * Assignment is stable per member id: the same id always maps to the same
 * colour, and ids spread across the palette before repeating.
