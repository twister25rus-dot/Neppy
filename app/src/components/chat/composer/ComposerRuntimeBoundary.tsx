/**
 * Guarantees `ChatComposer` has an assistant-ui runtime, without letting it
 * borrow the wrong one.
 *
 * The composer is built on `ComposerPrimitive`, which resolves its runtime from
 * React context. That creates a failure mode worth naming: a surface inside the
 * app shell that mounts no runtime of its own does not error — it silently
 * inherits the app-wide one from `ChatRuntimeProvider`, which is bound to
 * `state.thread.selectedThreadId`, the HOME chat's thread. Two surfaces were in
 * exactly that position (the flows Workflow Copilot, whose own provider closed
 * around its transcript only, and the orchestration agent chat, which has no
 * chat thread at all); both now mount their own runtime explicitly, because a
 * composer pointed at an unrelated conversation is a data-loss-shaped bug.
 *
 * This boundary is the net under that decision, not a replacement for it. Where
 * a runtime already exists it is a pass-through and the surface keeps whatever
 * scoping it chose. Where none exists — page-level tests that mount a chat
 * subtree directly, and any future host — it supplies an inert one rather than
 * throwing on the first render. The one thing it cannot do is second-guess an
 * *inherited* runtime: from inside the subtree a wrong thread and a right one
 * look identical, which is why the scoping decision has to be made at the mount
 * site.
 *
 * The branch is stable per surface: a subtree either has a provider above it or
 * does not, so this never flips and never remounts the composer mid-life.
