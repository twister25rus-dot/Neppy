/**
 * The chat composer, rebuilt on assistant-ui's **headless** `ComposerPrimitive`
 * and styled from its default composer's spec (ported in
 * `composer/composerStyles.ts` — see that file for the class-by-class mapping).
 *
 * Upstream's structure is reproduced:
 *
 * ```
 * <ComposerRoot>            // ComposerPrimitive.Root — a <form>
 *   <ComposerAttachments/>  // attachment strip
 *   <ComposerAddAttachment/>
 *   <ComposerInput rows={1}/>
 *   <ComposerAction/>       // send, or cancel while running
 * </ComposerRoot>
 * ```
 *
 * ## What comes from the primitive, and what deliberately does not
 *
 * From the primitive: the `<form>` wrapper (blank-space click focuses the
 * input, Enter routes through `requestSubmit`), the auto-resizing textarea with
 * its composition/IME tracking, Escape-to-cancel, and the composer text store
 * that `useComposerTextBridge` mirrors this app's `inputValue` into.
 *
 * **Not** from the primitive: sending. `ComposerPrimitive.Send` and
 * `ComposerPrimitive.Cancel` fire `aui.composer.send()` / `.cancel()`, which the
 * external-store runtime forwards to `chatSurfaceHandlers` as
 * `send(text: string)`. That signature cannot carry this composer's
 * attachments, and it knows nothing about the OpenHuman-specific modifier
 * semantics `allowParallelSend` implements (plain Enter queues a follow-up
 * mid-stream; Cmd/Ctrl+Enter forks a parallel branch) — routing a send through
 * it would silently drop attachments and collapse the two modifiers into one.
 * So the action buttons stay this app's, and `Root`'s `onSubmit` is intercepted
 * with `preventDefault()`, which (via Radix's `composeEventHandlers`) suppresses
 * the primitive's own submit handler. Enter therefore still reaches
 * `handleInputKeyDown`, which owns the modifier semantics.
 *
 * `ComposerPrimitive.AddAttachment` and `.Attachments` are likewise unused:
 * both require an attachment adapter on the runtime, and this app's attachments
 * are read, validated, compressed and budgeted by the host surface long before
 * the composer sees them. The upstream *look* of both is still applied.
 *
 * Similarly, upstream's `ComposerAction` morphs send/cancel off
 * `ThreadPrimitive.If running`. Here the same decision reads `isSending` — not
 * a different source of truth: the runtime adapter's `isRunning` is itself
 * derived from `chatRuntime.inferenceTurnLifecycleByThread`, the very state the
 * host surface passes down as `isSending`. Reading it directly keeps the
 * composer renderable by surfaces whose thread is not the runtime's.
 *
 * ## Runtime context
 *
 * `ComposerPrimitive.*` reads its runtime from React context, so every surface
 * rendering this component should sit under a runtime scoped to *its own*
 * thread. Two did not, and would have inherited the app-wide one bound to
 * `selectedThreadId` — the home chat's thread; both now mount their own (see
 * `WorkflowCopilotPanel` and `orchestration/AgentChatPanel`). The default
 * export wraps this body in `ComposerRuntimeBoundary`, which supplies an inert
 * runtime when there is none at all; read that file before assuming the
 * boundary makes the per-surface decision unnecessary — it cannot, because an
 * inherited runtime and a correct one are indistinguishable from in here.
