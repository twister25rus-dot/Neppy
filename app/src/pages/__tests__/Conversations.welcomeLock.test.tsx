// [#1123] All welcome-lock UI behavior was removed when the welcome-agent
// onboarding was replaced by a Joyride walkthrough. This file covers the
// unlocked behavior that replaced the removed code.
//
// Previously this file tested welcome-lock features (filtered thread list,
// "Onboarding" title override, forced sidebar, hidden delete buttons). Those
// are gone. What remains:
//   - Conversations composer is accessible with no active thread and rust chat ready
//   - isComposerInteractionBlocked respects the unlocked path correctly
