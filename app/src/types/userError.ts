/**
 * User-actionable runtime errors (#3931).
 *
 * A small, privacy-safe contract for *expected user states* that the app must
 * surface durably and actionably — e.g. a BYO provider being out of credits or
 * a managed budget being exhausted (the #3913 paths). These are deliberately
 * NOT Sentry-worthy crashes, but they must not vanish either: they land in a
 * first-class panel in the desktop shell with a clear next action.
 *
 * This is intentionally a thin, additive frontend contract for the first slice.
 * The structured Rust-core emission path (stable `message_key` + args emitted by
 * core rather than classified from text app-side) is the planned follow-up; this
 * type is shaped to accept that source without the panel changing.

 * Stable discriminator the UI branches on. Extend as new states are added.

 * `memory_budget_exhausted` (#5324) is deliberately separate from
 * `budget_exceeded` even though both originate in the same managed cycle
 * budget: the consequence and the fix differ. Chat being gated is immediately
 * visible and is fixed by adding credits; memory silently stopping is
 * invisible and is fixed by pointing embeddings at local Ollama or a BYO key.
 * Collapsing them would send memory users to the billing screen, which does
 * not solve their problem.
