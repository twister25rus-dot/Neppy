/**
 * Optional-safe reads of the assistant-ui runtime for the CURRENT subtree.
 *
 * Two properties make these hooks usable from the transcript, and both are
 * load-bearing:
 *
 * 1. **They read the runtime from React context**, never from
 *    `state.thread.selectedThreadId`. `AssistantUiRuntimeProvider` is
 *    thread-parameterized and `ChatThreadView` is mounted by two hosts — the
 *    home chat (follows the selection) and `WorkflowCopilotPanel` (its own
 *    nested runtime on a dedicated builder thread). Reading the selection here
 *    would paint the home chat's state inside the copilot.
 *
 * 2. **They tolerate the runtime being absent.** Every selector goes through
 *    `s.optional.<scope>`, which resolves to `undefined` rather than throwing
 *    when no `AuiProvider` is above the component (assistant-ui's default
 *    client throws on a direct `s.thread` read). `ChatThreadView` is rendered
 *    without a runtime in several unit tests — including
 *    `ChatThreadView.renderPerf.test.tsx`, which must stay byte-identical — so
 *    a hook that threw outside a provider would make the transcript
 *    un-mountable there.
 *
 * Selectors are module-level constants: `useAuiState` keys its internal
 * memoization on selector identity, so an inline arrow would re-subscribe the
 * underlying `useSyncExternalStore` on every render of the chat's hot path.

 * that faithfully, so this hook is the honest gate for those affordances rather
 * than a hard-coded `false` that would rot the day the adapter grows them.
