  // The group header is a static section label — the live "working" state is
  // conveyed by the pulsing agent-name rows, so it never repeats a "Working…"
  // string. Absent a user override, the group is auto-driven: open while the
  // run is in flight so the live activity is visible; collapsed once it
  // settles so a finished run (which can be dozens of steps) never dominates
  // the conversation. The full "Agent Process Source" panel forces every row
  // open via `expandAllRows`. Once the user has explicitly toggled the group,
  // THAT choice wins over the auto rule — otherwise a new turn streaming onto
  // an already-mounted block (settling, or starting a fresh run) would
  // silently flip `open` out from under the user's manual choice on every
  // turn.
  //
  // Driven by `settleSignal` (i.e. `turnActive` when the caller supplies it),
  // NOT by `isRunning`. `isRunning` means "a tool is executing *this instant*",
  // which goes false in every gap BETWEEN tools — while the agent reasons about
  // a result before issuing the next call. Keyed off that, the group snapped
  // shut a beat after each tool result and reopened when the next call started,
  // so a multi-tool turn flickered and a just-delivered result looked like it
  // had been wiped. #5008 already established `turnActive` as the correct
  // whole-turn signal and applied it to the override reset above; `autoOpen`
  // was left behind on `isRunning`. Same signal now drives both, so the group
  // stays open for the WHOLE turn and collapses once, at settle.
