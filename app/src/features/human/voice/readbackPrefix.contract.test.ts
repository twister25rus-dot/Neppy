/**
 * The read-back prefix is a behavioural contract that spans two languages: the
 * renderer wraps a deferred answer in it, and the Rust harness recognises it to
 * answer the turn from the prompt instead of rebuilding an orchestrator — and to
 * stop speak-back re-arming into an unbounded loop.
 *
 * Both sides carry the string verbatim with a "MUST match" comment, but a comment
 * is not a check: if one side is edited, `readback_payload` silently stops
 * matching and the loop guard fails open, with every unit test on each side still
 * passing (they assert against their own copy). This reads the Rust source and
 * pins the two together, so a divergence fails here instead of in a live call.
