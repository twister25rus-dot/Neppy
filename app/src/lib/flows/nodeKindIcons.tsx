/**
 * Per-kind canvas iconography for the 14 tinyflows `NodeKind`s.
 *
 * Split out of `nodeKindMeta.ts` on purpose: that module is deliberately
 * dependency-free (no React) so a plain palette button and a `<Handle>`-bearing
 * canvas card can share one source of truth. Icon *components* are React, so
 * they live here and are keyed by the same `NodeKind` union — the two modules
 * stay in lockstep because both are exhaustive `Record<NodeKind, …>` maps, and
 * TypeScript fails the build if a kind is added to one and not the other.
 *
 * These replace the emoji the canvas previously rendered. Emoji were a
 * liability for a workflow surface: their glyphs are supplied by the platform,
 * so the same graph looked materially different on macOS, Windows and Linux;
 * they carry their own colour, which fought the card's own state colouring; and
 * they read as informal next to the rest of the product. Lucide (via
 * `react-icons/lu`) is already the house set — it is by far the most-used icon
 * family in `app/src` — so these inherit `currentColor` and sit at the same
 * optical weight as the icons in Settings and Chat.

/**
 * The tile fill behind each kind's glyph — the one saturated element on an
 * otherwise neutral card.
 *
 * **Why colour lives on the tile and not the card.** A fully neutral card is
 * unreadable on this product's dark theme: the canvas is pure black, `surface`
 * is `#171717` and `line` is `#262626`, so a grey-on-grey card has almost no
 * hue and almost no luminance contrast. But colouring the *card* by kind is
 * what the previous design did, and it broke status: `sage` and `coral` mean
 * success and error everywhere else in the product, so a healthy `merge` node
 * rendered green and a `tool_call` amber read as run state rather than type.
 *
 * A 32px tile resolves both. It is saturated enough to give the canvas life and
 * to make kinds recognisable at a glance before the label is readable, while
 * run state stays legible because it is drawn on a different surface — a ring
 * around the whole card. Identity is a filled square; status is an outline.
 * The two never compete for the same pixels.
 *
 * Gradients rather than flat fills: the darker stop guarantees the white glyph
 * clears contrast even where the lighter stop (`accent-lavender`, `accent-sky`)
 * is too pale to carry white on its own.
 *
 * Hues are grouped by role so the mapping is learnable rather than arbitrary —
 * warm for control flow that branches, ocean for anything reaching outside the
 * graph, violet for the AI-backed kinds, green for kinds that recombine, and
 * cool grey for pure data shaping.
