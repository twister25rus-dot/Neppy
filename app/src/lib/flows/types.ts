/**
 * TypeScript mirror of the `tinyflows` workflow model (`tinyflows::model`,
 * currently pinned at 0.3.0 — see root `Cargo.toml`). This is the frontend's
 * only view onto the wire shape of `Flow.graph` (kept as `unknown` in
 * `services/api/flowsApi.ts` since the list page never needs to interpret
 * it) — the canvas (issue B5b) is the first consumer.
 *
 * Field names/optionality are checked directly against
 * `tinyflows-0.3.0/src/model/mod.rs` and `node_kind.rs` (no `rename_all` on
 * the Rust structs, so field names are snake_case on the wire as-is, same
 * convention as `flowsApi.ts`'s wire types). Two deliberate deviations from a
 * naive "camelCase everything" TS port, both intentional so this file stays a
 * faithful mirror instead of drifting from the Rust source of truth:
 *
 * - `Port` has no `kind: 'input' | 'output'` discriminant — the Rust struct is
 *   just `{ name, label? }`. `Node.ports` is documented on the Rust side as
 *   "Declared output ports (for branching / multi-output nodes)" — i.e. it is
 *   *only* ever a list of a node's extra output ports, never inputs. Nodes
 *   with a single default output (most kinds) leave it empty; a `switch`
 *   node's *actual* case ports are computed at runtime from its `config`
 *   (see `tinyflows`'s `SwitchNode::execute`) and aren't guaranteed to appear
 *   here at all — the graph's `edges` are the only fully authoritative source
 *   for which ports are actually wired. `graphAdapter.ts` accounts for this by
 *   deriving the *effective* input/output handles for the canvas from a union
 *   of `Node.ports` and the edges touching that node, rather than trusting
 *   `Node.ports` alone.
 * - `Position` is `{ x: number; y: number }` (both required numbers), matching
 *   the Rust struct exactly; it's `Node.position` itself that is optional
 *   (`Option<Position>`), not the fields within it.

/**
 * The 15 node kinds `tinyflows` currently defines (`tinyflows::model::NodeKind`).
 * Wire values are `snake_case` (`#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]`).
 *
 * `memory` (issue #5226) is the 13th kind — declarative, in-graph memory
 * access (`recall`/`search`/`flavour`/`people`/`remember`/`forget`, see
 * `my_docs/memory_access_in_workflows/08-memory-node.md`). Its config is
 * still the same free-form `WorkflowNode.config` bag as every other kind
 * (see {@link WorkflowNode}); there is no dedicated TS config interface
 * because no other kind has one either — the node-config form
 * (`nodeConfig/memoryFields.tsx`) reads/writes the known keys
 * (`operation`, `scope`, `query`, `flavour`, `key`, `value`, `limit`,
 * `min_score`) directly off that bag, same as `condition`/`switch`/etc.
 *
 * `dedup` (issue #5263) is the 14th kind — skips items already seen, keyed
 * by a stable per-item `=`-expression (e.g. `=item.id`). Same free-form
 * config bag pattern: its one field, `key`, is read/written directly by
 * `nodeConfig/dedupFields.tsx`.
 *
 * `loop` is the 15th kind — a bounded loop head. It emits on `body` until its
 * `max_iterations` cap (or its optional `condition`) says otherwise, then on
 * `done`; the loop is closed by wiring the body's last node back to it. Same
 * free-form config bag: `max_iterations`, `on_exceeded` (`error` | `continue`),
 * and `condition` are read/written by `nodeConfig/loopFields.tsx`.
