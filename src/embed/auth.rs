//! Auth sub-facade — the session a turn runs under.
//!
//! # Why an embedder needs this at all
//!
//! A custom provider — anything other than the account's managed backend — is
//! gated on an active app-session JWT (`verify_session_active`,
//! `inference/provider/factory.rs`). The gate is there to stop an unregistered
//! desktop user from configuring every workload at a custom endpoint and
//! bypassing registration entirely; it is not aimed at a library host that was
//! handed an endpoint and a key by its own operator. But the check has no way to
//! tell those apart, so an embedder has to present a session like anyone else.
//!
//! Before this existed, every embedder reached for `Core::raw()` and hand-wrote
//! `openhuman.auth_store_session` — which is how an unrelated host ends up
//! owning a copy of the `{result, logs}` envelope heuristic and a private
//! version of the auth state struct.
//!
//! # Two kinds of session
//!
//! [`Session::backend`] is a real JWT: it is validated against `GET /auth/me`
//! before anything is persisted, and a failure means nothing is stored.
//! [`Session::local`] is the offline form — a token ending in `.local`, carrying
//! its own user payload, which the core recognizes and does not try to validate.
//! It authorizes nothing at the backend; it exists so a host with its own
//! credentials can satisfy a gate that was written about a different situation.
