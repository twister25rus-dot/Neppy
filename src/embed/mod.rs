//! Typed embedding facade over [`CoreRuntime`].
//!
//! [`CoreBuilder`](crate::core::runtime::CoreBuilder) gives an embedder a
//! running core; [`CoreRuntime::invoke`] gives it JSON. This module is the
//! third piece: real Rust types, so a host application never writes
//! `serde_json::json!` or matches on an error string.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn demo() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//! use openhuman_core::embed::Core;
//! use openhuman_core::{CoreBuilder, DomainSet, HostKind, ServiceSet};
//!
//! let runtime = CoreBuilder::new(HostKind::detect_standalone())
//!     .domains(DomainSet::full())
//!     .services(ServiceSet::none())
//!     .build()
//!     .await?;
//!
//! let core = Core::from_runtime(Arc::new(runtime));
//! let flags = core.config().runtime_flags().await?;
//! println!("log_prompts={}", flags.log_prompts);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # Shape: a struct with borrowed sub-facades, not a trait
//!
//! A single trait spanning every domain would run to well over a hundred
//! methods and force each test double to stub all of them. Instead [`Core`] is
//! a concrete struct whose accessors return zero-cost newtypes over a borrow.
//!
//! Traits appear in exactly one place in this architecture — the **ports**,
//! where a host injects behaviour *downward* into the core (a workflow's
//! harness dispatcher, for instance). Facade and port are opposite directions
//! and deliberately use opposite mechanisms:
//!
//! | Direction | Mechanism |
//! |---|---|
//! | host calls core | this facade — concrete struct, typed methods |
//! | core calls host | a port — trait object installed by the host |
//!
//! # Gated domains
//!
//! Sub-facade accessors for gated domains are `#[cfg]`-compiled, so
//! `core.workflows()` simply does not exist in a build without that feature —
//! a compile error at the call site rather than a runtime surprise. For domains
//! present at compile time but switched off at runtime via
//! [`DomainSet`](crate::core::runtime::DomainSet), calls return
//! [`CoreError::Unavailable`] so a host can hide the surface instead of
//! reporting a failure.
