//! Agent sub-facade — running one turn, typed.
//!
//! Follows the shape [`super::config`] established (a borrowed newtype over the
//! runtime, methods delegating to [`call`](super::call::call)) and adds the two
//! things a turn needs that a plain config read does not: **ambient scopes** and
//! a **session identity**.
//!
//! # Why the params are a struct rather than `json!`
//!
//! The controller behind this method deserializes
//! [`AgentChatParams`](crate::openhuman::inference::local::schemas) — which
//! carries no `#[serde(rename_all)]`, so its wire names are the Rust field names
//! exactly as spelled. Every embedder that hand-writes that JSON is therefore
//! depending on an unmarked, unversioned naming coincidence: rename a field
//! upstream and the call keeps compiling, keeps dispatching, and silently loses
//! the value. [`TurnRequest`] pins the spelling in one place, next to a test
//! that decodes it as the controller does.
//!
//! # The two ambient scopes, and why they are not optional
//!
//! A turn reads two `tokio` task-locals that no parameter can carry:
//!
//! - **origin** ([`turn_origin`](crate::openhuman::agent::turn_origin)) — the
//!   caller's statement of authority. The approval gate is *fail-closed*: an
//!   unlabelled call gets the `Cli` default, and a caller wanting anything
//!   else — a workflow's blanket automation grant, say — must scope it around
//!   the dispatch. Miss it and the turn still succeeds while every acting tool
//!   quietly refuses, which reads as a bad model rather than a missing scope.
//! - **progress** ([`progress_sink`](crate::openhuman::agent::progress_sink)) —
//!   the call resolves to one final string, so an embedder that wants tool
//!   calls and deltas has to have installed the sink *before* awaiting.
//!
//! Both are established by [`Turn::send`], so a host never has to know they
//! exist. That is the whole reason this facade is worth having over `invoke`.
