//! The one-call front door: build a harness, run turns on it.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn demo() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! use openhuman_core::{Access, Harness, Provider, Session, Workspace};
//!
//! let harness = Harness::builder()
//!     .provider(Provider::openai_compatible("https://api.example/v1", "sk-…").model("gpt-5"))
//!     .workspace(Workspace::Ephemeral)
//!     .access(Access::readonly())
//!     // Both of these are effectively required when running on your own
//!     // endpoint rather than a signed-in account — see "Running on your own
//!     // endpoint" below. Omit them and the first turn fails SESSION_EXPIRED.
//!     .session(Session::local("my-host"))
//!     .backend_url("https://my-backend.example")
//!     .build()
//!     .await?;
//!
//! let first = harness.run("Summarize what you can see.").await?;
//! println!("{}", first.reply);
//!
//! // Continue the same conversation.
//! let second = harness
//!     .turn("Now list the risks.")
//!     .session(&first.session_id)
//!     .send()

//! println!("{}", second.reply);
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! # What this is, relative to the rest of `embed`
//!
//! [`Core`](crate::embed::Core) is the typed facade over a [`CoreRuntime`] the
//! caller already built. `Harness` is the layer above: it *builds* that runtime
//! from typed inputs, owns the workspace's lifetime, and applies the harness's
//! own provider and access defaults to every turn. A host that already has a
//! `CoreRuntime` — the desktop shell, an existing embedder — wants
//! `Core::agent()` and should skip this module entirely.
//!
//! # Running on your own endpoint
//!
//! Supplying a [`Provider`] is not quite the whole story, because two things in
//! the core are about the *account* rather than about where completions go:
//!
//! - Routing at a custom provider is gated on an active app session. The gate
//!   exists to stop an unregistered desktop user configuring every workload at
//!   a custom endpoint and skipping registration, and it cannot tell that case
//!   apart from a library host holding operator-supplied credentials — so the
//!   host presents a session like anyone else. [`Session::local`] satisfies it
//!   without asserting anything at the backend.
//! - The core still makes non-inference backend calls (the session check,
//!   integrations, telemetry). Left pointing at the hosted backend while signed
//!   out, those are rejected — and a rejection publishes `SessionExpired`, which
//!   fails the *next* turn's provider gate for reasons that have nothing to do
//!   with the turn. [`HarnessBuilder::backend_url`] points them somewhere else.
//!
//! Neither applies to [`Provider::inherit`] with [`Workspace::Inherit`], which
//! runs exactly as the installed app does, session included.
//!
//! # Two things the harness cannot do for you
//!
//! **The tokio runtime is yours, and its stack size matters.** One agent turn is
//! an enormous async state machine, and delegating to a sub-agent nests another
//! inside it; tokio's default 2 MiB worker stack overflows and aborts the
//! process. Build the runtime with
//! [`AGENT_WORKER_STACK_BYTES`](crate::core::runtime::AGENT_WORKER_STACK_BYTES)
//! and [`MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS`](crate::core::runtime::MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS):
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use openhuman_core::core::runtime::{AGENT_WORKER_STACK_BYTES, MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS};
//!
//! let runtime = tokio::runtime::Builder::new_multi_thread()
//!     .enable_all()
//!     .thread_stack_size(AGENT_WORKER_STACK_BYTES)
//!     .max_blocking_threads(MAX_BLOCKING_THREADS)
//!     .build()
//!     .expect("tokio runtime");
//! ```
//!
//! **One harness per process.** The keyring master key, the RPC bearer, the
//! global event bus and the `Once`-guarded domain subscribers are all
//! process-scoped, so two harnesses would silently share them while believing
//! they had separate workspaces. [`HarnessBuilder::build`] returns
//! [`HarnessError::AlreadyRunning`] rather than letting that happen. Lifting the
//! restriction is phase 3 of `docs/plans/pluggable-core/`.
