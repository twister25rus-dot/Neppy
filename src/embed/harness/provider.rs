//! Which model answers, and where the request goes.
//!
//! # Why this is a per-turn route and not a config write
//!
//! The obvious way to point a harness at an endpoint — writing `inference_url` /
//! `api_key` / `cloud_providers` through the config — is wrong for a library:
//! those fields are **persisted**, so a caller borrowing an endpoint for its own
//! turns would repoint the operator's whole install, and a crash between the
//! write and the restore would leave it repointed for good.
//!
//! So [`Provider`] compiles down to the core's
//! [`EphemeralRoute`](crate::openhuman::config::schema::EphemeralRoute) — a
//! `#[serde(skip)]` field that has no place in `config.toml` to be saved into,
//! carried per call. The route pins only the four roles a turn actually runs on
//! (chat, reasoning, agentic, coding) and deliberately leaves the background
//! roles — memory, embeddings, heartbeat, learning — alone, because those run
//! tier-specific models a chat endpoint generally cannot serve.
