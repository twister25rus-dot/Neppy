//! The process-wide bus singleton.
//!
//! Everything that used to be `core::event_bus` now comes from `tinybus`. What
//! is left here is the one thing a generic bus crate cannot own: a `static`
//! typed to *this* application's event catalog. `tinybus::OnceBus<E>` is
//! generic over `E`, so there is no single type for it to declare a static of —
//! the host declares it, and gets the whole surface off it.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use crate::core::bus::BUS;
//! use crate::core::events::DomainEvent;
//!
//! BUS.publish(DomainEvent::SystemStartup { component: "example".into() });
//! let _sub = BUS.subscribe(Arc::new(MyHandler));
//! let resp: Resp = BUS.native().request("agent.run_turn", req).await?;
//! ```
//!
//! # The two surfaces, and which to use
//!
//! | Need | Use |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | tell anyone who cares that something happened | [`BUS`]`.publish` |
//! | call another module with a payload that is plain data | [`BUS`]`.publish` + a reply event, or a native request |
//! | call another module passing `Arc`s, trait objects or channels | [`BUS`]`.native()` |
//! | call an out-of-process integration | a `tinybus::Proxy` off [`BUS`]`.get()?.connection()` |
//!
//! The native registry is **not** a legacy path. Events are serialized now, and
//! `AgentTurnRequest` carries `Arc<Vec<Box<dyn Tool>>>` and a live progress
//! channel; there is no encoding of those that survives a process boundary, so
//! that surface stays in-process permanently and by design.
//!
//! # Before initialisation
//!
//! Every accessor is safe before [`init`] runs: publishing is a no-op that logs
//! at `trace`, subscribing returns `None`. Unit tests that never stand a bus up
//! keep working, and an early-startup publish does not panic.
