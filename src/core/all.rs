///
/// The harness families (`Agent`/`Memory`/`Threads`/`Config`/`Security`) are on

///
/// **Groups track `src/openhuman/` family directories 1:1.** Before the domain
/// reorg (#5328) they could not: a capability lived across up to 13 sibling

/// of a family to name. That made two things wrong which are now fixed:
///

///   silently dropped `agent::{harness_init, artifacts, learning}`,
///   `security::{credentials, devices}`, `config::{workspace, migration_helpers}`,
///   `memory::people` and `skills::webhooks`, all of which sat in `Platform`.
///   An agent harness that does not register `harness_init` is a latent bug.
/// - `embedded()` had to set `platform: true` purely to reach credentials and
///   config, which dragged in the desktop and hosted-backend surfaces it has no
///   use for. Those are now `Desktop` and `Hosted` and stay off.
///
/// `Platform` is now what its name says: the kernel surfaces with no family of
/// their own (`platform/`, `tools/`, `http_host/`, `test_support/`).
