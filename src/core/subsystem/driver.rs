//! Generic, subsystem-agnostic driver vocabulary for the OpenHuman kernel.
//!
//! Specified by `docs/specs/kernel.md` §3.1 (driver classes), §3.3 (degradation
//! by absence), §3.7 (fallback is never silent), and §6 item 1.
//!
//! ## Why this is not imported from `tinycortex-api`
//!
//! [`DriverClass`], [`DriverHealth`], and [`DriverCapabilities`] are shared by
//! every subsystem — memory today, inference / channels / sandbox next
//! (kernel.md §5). A *memory* crate must not be the source of generic kernel
//! vocabulary, and a third-party driver must be able to depend on the contract
//! crate without pulling in the host. The contract crate states both halves of
//! that rule itself (`vendor/tinycortex/api/src/lib.rs`, module docs of
//! `vendor/tinycortex/api/src/health.rs`).
//!
//! So the contract carries `MemoryHealth` / `Capabilities`, this module carries
//! the kernel's equivalents, and the **memory adapter converts at the
//! boundary** — never this module. Nothing in this file names `tinycortex_api`;
//! the only place the two vocabularies meet in this step is a test-only witness
//! that pins the shapes one-for-one so the future conversion stays a total
//! three-arm `match`.
//!
//! Driver *class* is a host configuration fact about how a driver was bound,
//! not something a driver reports about itself — which is why the contract
//! crate deliberately omits it. A driver that self-reported `Embedded` could
//! skip the egress and trust checks that class gates.
