//! `CoreBuilder` → `CoreRuntime`: the embeddable composition surface.
//!
//! This is the first-class library API for hosting the OpenHuman core. It
//! splits the monolithic `run_server_inner` into two phases:
//!
//! 1. [`CoreBuilder::build`] — *initialization only*: register controllers, load
//!    the master key, seed the RPC bearer, initialize workspace-bound stores,
//!    and run the pure-registration part of [`bootstrap_core_runtime`]. No port
//!    is bound and `ServiceSet::none` / `ServiceSet::headless_api` start no
//!    background loops. After `build`, [`CoreRuntime::invoke`] can dispatch any
//!    RPC method in-process, and agent turns can run — so a harness-only embedder
//!    (`ServiceSet::none`) needs nothing more.
//! 2. [`CoreRuntime::serve`] — *transport + background services*: bind the HTTP
//!    listener, mount the router, fire the readiness signal, spawn the selected
//!    background services, and serve until shutdown.
//!
//! The legacy entry points (`run_server`, `run_server_embedded`,
//! `run_server_embedded_with_ready`) are now thin shims over this builder, so
//! the desktop shell, the standalone CLI, and any new embedder share one path.
//! See `docs/plans/pluggable-core/phase-1-corebuilder.md`.
