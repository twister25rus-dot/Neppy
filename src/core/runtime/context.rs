//! the workspace-bound stores, and run pure `bootstrap_core_runtime` registration. Today it is a
//! facade — the store init still targets the process globals — but centralizing
//! the sequence here is the seam the later stages build on (handler-threaded
//! context, per-context stores). See `docs/plans/pluggable-core/phase-2-corecontext.md`.
