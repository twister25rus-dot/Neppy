//! x402 — HTTP 402 payment protocol for machine-payable APIs.
//!
//! Intercepts HTTP 402 responses carrying a `PAYMENT-REQUIRED` header,
//! constructs a Solana SPL token payment (typically USDC), signs it with the
//! wallet's ed25519 key, and retries the request with the payment proof in a
//! `PAYMENT-SIGNATURE` header. The facilitator co-signs as fee payer and
//! broadcasts, so the client never needs SOL for gas.
//!
//! Protocol spec: <https://x402.org> / coinbase/x402 (v2).

//! ## Compile-time gate (`web3` feature)
//!
//! `pub mod x402;` is ALWAYS compiled — it is a facade. The real payment
//! machinery is gated behind the default-ON `web3` Cargo feature (shared with
//! `openhuman::web3::wallet` + `openhuman::web3`). When the feature is off, [`stub`]
//! takes its place and exposes the always-on entry points (`init_ledger`,
//! `all_x402_registered_controllers`, `all_x402_controller_schemas`) with
//! no-op / empty bodies. The `X402RequestTool` and the http_request 402-retry
//! path are `#[cfg(feature = "web3")]` at their call sites, so the rest of the
//! payment surface (`PaymentRecord`, `store`, `SettlementResponse`, …) is not
//! referenced when off and need not be stubbed.
