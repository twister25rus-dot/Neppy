//! Structured WhatsApp Web data — shared DTOs + agent query tools.
//!
//! **Storage lives in the Tauri shell, not the core.** The SQLite store, the
//! scanner-side ingest write path, and the list/search business logic were
//! relocated to `app/src-tauri/src/whatsapp_data/` (desktop-only). The core
//! keeps only:
//!
//! - [`types`] — the shared serde DTOs (chat / message rows, list / search /
//!   ingest request + response types). Both the core agent tools and the shell
//!   store reference this single definition so the two sides never drift.
//! - [`tools`] — the three read-only agent tools. Their bodies dispatch over
//!   the in-process native request bus
//!   (`openhuman_core::core::bus::BUS.native().request`) keyed by
//!   `whatsapp_data.list_chats` / `.list_messages` / `.search_messages`. The
//!   shell registers the matching handlers at startup.
//!
//! When no shell handler is registered (headless / CLI / docker — no desktop),
//! the tools degrade gracefully to an empty result with a "WhatsApp data
//! unavailable (desktop only)" note rather than erroring.
//!
//! **Data locality**: all data remains on-device; it is never transmitted to
//! any external service.
