//! Enforcement lint: the set of production files that call `tinymemory-core`
//! **directly**, around the module seam, must not grow.
//!
//! # Why a second path to memory is a correctness problem, not a size problem
//!
//! `memory::binding` says it plainly: "the built-in driver is the compiled
//! TinyMemory TinyBus module. The host no longer exposes an embedded engine
//! class for memory." Every call that goes over that bus is round-tripped
//! through [`crate::openhuman::memory::api::wire`]'s error table — the one
//! `modules/memory.rs` keeps shared "because reimplementing the mapping here is
//! what would let a `PathEscape` arrive as an `Invalid`, silently reclassifying
//! a sandbox escape as a caller mistake" — and is filtered by the capability
//! set `ModuleMemoryProvider::verify` cross-checks against the module's own
//! answer.
//!
//! A direct `tinymemory_core::…` call gets neither. It is a second, unpoliced
//! door into the same subsystem, and two doors into one capability is a
//! capability whose behaviour can diverge. `tinymemory-core` also stays linked
//! into the shipped binary — 1.44 MB of `.text`, the 7th largest crate — for as
//! long as any of these remain, which is the visible symptom rather than the
//! disease (#5560).
//!
//! # This lint is a ratchet, not an invariant
//!
//! Same shape and same reasoning as [`super::bypass_allowlist_tests`], and as
//! `INTENTIONALLY_NOT_FORWARDED` in `scripts/lib/feature-forwarding.mjs`: the
//! current direct callers are enumerated in [`ALLOWED`] with a classification
//! and a reason each, and **that list may shrink but must never grow**. A lint
//! that was red on day one would be `#[ignore]`d within a week; a green ratchet
//! converges.
//!
//! # The classification, and why most of the list cannot move yet
//!
//! Each entry carries a [`Verdict`], which is the inventory the migration is
//! driven from:
//!
//! - [`Verdict::SeamExpressible`] — the existing `MemoryProvider` surface
//!   already covers this. These are the ones to migrate; a non-empty set here
//!   is a to-do list, not a steady state.
//! - [`Verdict::NeedsWiderSeam`] — the call wants something the thirteen
//!   capability families do not expose. **These are blocked upstream, not
//!   here.** `modules::registry` pins the TinyMemory module to a released,
//!   SHA-256-verified artifact (v1.0.1 at the time of writing), so a new bus
//!   method is a `tinymemory` release plus a registry re-pin before it is a
//!   host change. Adding the trait method alone would produce a driver that
//!   answers `Unsupported` — strictly worse than the direct call it replaced,
//!   because the failure moves from compile time to run time.
//! - [`Verdict::HostSide`] — not a driver call at all. Re-export shims,
//!   host-seam installation, and inert type imports. These are correct as they
//!   stand and are counted only so "deliberate" stays distinguishable from
//!   "forgotten".
//!
//! ## The concrete gaps, for whoever picks the upstream work up
//!
//! **This list was drained on 2026-08-23 and the shape of the problem changed.**
//! It used to enumerate four things the seam could not express — retrieval
//! filters, chunk reads, an entity-kind filter, and source listing — plus the
//! people domain and the `source_scope` task-local. Every one of those now has
//! a home:
//!
//! - **Retrieval filters, chunk reads, entity-kind search** — `MemoryRetrieval`
//!   (`fast_retrieve`, `cover_window`, `retrieve_source`, `retrieve_children`,
//!   `retrieve_leaves`, `recall_namespace_scored`, `search_entities`) and
//!   `MemoryChunks` (`list_chunks`, `get_chunk`, `chunk_detail`,
//!   `storage_kinds`, `chunk_embeddings`).
//! - **The people domain** — `MemoryPeople`, seven methods.
//! - **Profile/facets** — `MemoryProfile`, eleven methods, which
//!   `memory::guard`'s docs separately described as a missing "fourteenth
//!   family".
//! - **`source_scope`** — not a seam gap at all. It is host policy; it lives in
//!   `memory::source_scope`, and the scope crosses the bus as a `SourceScope`
//!   value on every scoped method.
//!
//! `ModuleMemoryProvider` implements all of these bar `as_episodic`, and
//! `MemoryGuard` wraps all fifteen families.
//!
//! **So what blocks the migration is release lag, not seam width.**
//! `modules::registry` pins a SHA-256-verified artifact, and the five families
//! above shipped in no release until v1.2.0. Before migrating a call site onto
//! one, check the *tag* rather than the vendored source — the submodule is
//! routinely ahead of what is pinned. A method the pinned artifact does not
//! serve answers `Unsupported` at run time, which is strictly worse than the
//! direct call it replaced.
//!
//! What genuinely has no bus representation yet, and is the next upstream ask:
//! the ingest `queue`, the `chat` runtime seam, the composio sync pipelines,
//! and **recency recall**. The first three live inside `tinymemory-core` and
//! would each need a design pass, not just a trait method.
//!
//! Recency recall is the subtle one, and it is worth spelling out because the
//! obvious migration is wrong. `MemoryRetrieval::recall_namespace_scored` looks
//! like the twin for `memory.recall_context` and `memory.recall_memories`, and
//! it is not:
//!
//! - `recall_namespace_scored` resolves to
//!   `query_namespace_hits_excluding_session(ns, query, limit, exclude)` — the
//!   **query-ranked** path.
//! - Both handlers call `recall_namespace_memories(ns, limit)` — a distinct
//!   **recency** path. `recall_namespace_context_data` is just that plus a
//!   rendered `context_text` wrapper.
//!
//! Passing an empty query to the scored method does not degrade to recency; it
//! runs the ranking path with nothing to rank against. The two share a prefix
//! (`load_documents_for_scope` + `kv_records_for_scope`) and diverge after it,
//! so the swap compiles, returns plausible hits, and quietly changes what the
//! user gets back. `memory.query_namespace` *is* safely expressible, because it
//! has a real query — pass `exclude_session_id: None` there to preserve the
//! current no-exclusion behaviour, since an RPC handler is not an agent turn.
//!
//! The upstream ask is a `RecallNamespaceRecent`-shaped method on
//! `MemoryRetrieval`.
//!
//! ## What the 2026-08-22 audit added to that list
//!
//! Draining `FacadeRevealed` turned 82 unexamined files into evidence, and it
//! widened the ask rather than narrowing it. Grouped by what blocks them, so
//! the upstream work can be sized per gap instead of per file:
//!
//! - **The engine handle itself** (~28 files) — `global::{init, client,
//!   client_if_ready}`, `store::{UnifiedMemory, MemoryClient, MemoryClientRef}`
//!   and `store::factories::create_memory`. These construct or hold the
//!   in-process engine. Nothing routes here: the seam has no door onto a live
//!   client, and it should not grow one — this is `memory::binding`'s job, and
//!   the ask is that every caller take the binding's provider instead.
//! - **Chunk writes and transactions** (~21 files) —
//!   `store::chunks::store::{with_connection, upsert_chunks,
//!   upsert_staged_chunks_tx, get_or_init_connection}`, plus `store::{fts5,
//!   segments, profile, events, content}`. `MemoryChunks` is a read family;
//!   this is the write half, and `with_connection` hands out a SQLite handle,
//!   which no engine-neutral contract can promise. **Moving these subsystems
//!   behind the bus is the only shape that keeps a supermemory/mem0/cognee
//!   driver implementable** — a contract with `with_connection` in it is a
//!   SQLite contract wearing a trait.
//! - **Host policy reached through the engine crate** — **drained.** The
//!   scrubbers (`store::safety::{sanitize_text, sanitize_json,
//!   has_likely_secret}`), `util::redact::redact`, `source_scope::*` and the
//!   Obsidian vault-registration probe (`store::content::obsidian_registry`)
//!   all live host-side now, in `memory::safety`, `util::redact`,
//!   `memory::source_scope` and `memory::obsidian_registry`. The route each
//!   took is the shape to reuse, and it is **not** "move it to
//!   `tinymemory-api`": a scrubber costs `regex` + `serde_json`,
//!   `util::redact` costs `sha2`, and the vault probe costs `dirs` +
//!   `serde_json`, in a crate whose whole point is that a caller can depend on
//!   it and compile almost nothing — and `source_scope` is a
//!   `tokio::task_local`, which would put tokio there too. None of the four is
//!   contract vocabulary — nothing crosses the bus as a `SanitizationReport`,
//!   a log hash or a `VaultRegistration`, and "is my content root a registered
//!   Obsidian vault" is not a capability a second driver would answer
//!   differently — so each is simply the host's, with the engine keeping its
//!   own copy for its own callers. Independent copies are the design: neither
//!   side reads the other's output.
//! - **The re-embed queue** (~8 files) — `queue::{start, store, types,
//!   ensure_reembed_backfill, requeue_failed_after_provider_change,
//!   drain_until_idle, wake_workers, backfill_in_progress}`. No family.
//! - **Engine-shaped integration internals** (~11 files) —
//!   `tinycortex::{memory_config_from, run_composio_connection,
//!   load_composio_sync_state, HostSyncAdapter, CodingSession*}`. Named after
//!   the engine, so no engine-neutral family can express them as they stand.
//! - **Engine-owned types** — `store::trees::types::TreeKind`, and
//!   `store::{NamespaceDocumentInput, NamespaceRetrievalContext,
//!   GraphRelationRecord}` (`store::chunks::types::SourceKind`/`SourceRef`
//!   were on this list and are **done** — see below). A type import links the
//!   crate exactly as a call does, so the shed needs these in
//!   `tinymemory-api`. `MemoryCategory`/`MemoryEntry`/`MemoryTaint` already
//!   are — `tinymemory_core::traits` re-exports them — so those call sites can
//!   name the contract today.
//!
//!   `rpc_models` was on this list and is **done**: all forty-five types were
//!   named by this host and by nothing inside `tinymemory`, so they moved to
//!   `memory::rpc_models` rather than into the contract. That is the shape to
//!   look for first in what remains — a type the engine crate defines but only
//!   the host uses does not need a contract to live in, it needs to come home.
//!   `SourceKind`/`SourceRef` were called out here as emphatically **not**
//!   such a case, on the grounds that the engine path resolved to a
//!   `tinycortex-api` type distinct from the contract's. That is no longer
//!   true: `tinycortex-api` is a deprecated re-export of `tinymemory-bus` and
//!   the two paths resolve to the **same item**, verified by a compile-time
//!   identity probe and then by repointing every call site. Prefer
//!   `tinymemory_api::chunks::…` in new code. The general warning still holds
//!   for *other* near-identical pairs — probe before assuming, either way.
//! - **Chat, ingest pipeline and preferences** (~12 files) —
//!   `chat::{ChatProvider, build_chat_provider, test_override}`,
//!   `ingest_pipeline::{ingest_chat, ingest_document_with_scope}`,
//!   `preferences::{STANDING_PREFS_LIMIT, load_general_preferences,
//!   recall_situational_preferences}`.
//!
//! The order that follows from this: relocate the pure helpers and types to
//! `tinymemory-api` (no bus surface, no release coupling), then move the
//! queue and chunk-write subsystems behind the module, and only then can the
//! handle-holding callers take the binding's provider and the crate leave the
//! build. Nothing here is a host-side routing pass, which is what the original
//! scope assumed.
//!
//! # Known weaknesses, stated rather than hidden
//!
//! - **The lint sees text, not types.** A reference reached through a
//!   re-export under another name is invisible to it — and the memory tree is
//!   full of those on purpose: `memory/mod.rs` re-exports twenty-five engine
//!   modules, and ~687 `memory::store::…` / `memory::tree::…` paths elsewhere
//!   resolve into the crate through them. **This lint deliberately does not
//!   count those.** It counts the sites that *name* the crate, because those
//!   are the ones a migration edits. The re-export surface is a separate,
//!   larger problem tracked in the issue, and pretending this number covers it
//!   would be the worst outcome.
//! - **By-path test files are out of scope** (`*_tests.rs`, `tests.rs`,
//!   `test_support/`), matching the sibling lint. Several inline
//!   `#[cfg(test)]` modules do name the crate (`query::drill_down`,
//!   `query::fetch_leaves`, `query::query_source` each assert a tool's result
//!   against a direct engine call); those files are listed, and the entry says
//!   so.
//! - **Comment lines are skipped**, so the many doc comments that reference
//!   `tinymemory_core::…` by path do not inflate the count.
