//! Per-workspace memory-driver binding — the memory subsystem's half of
//! `docs/specs/kernel.md` §3.1 (one driver per subsystem per process, per
//! workspace here), §3.4 (fail-closed trust), and §3.7 (a fallback is never
//! silent).
//!
//! ## Reached through [`CoreContext`], never through a global slot
//!
//! The binding is resolved by
//! [`CoreContext::memory_binding`](crate::core::runtime::CoreContext::memory_binding),
//! which keys on the context's workspace dir. The cache below is deliberately
//! shaped like
//! [`memory::people::store::for_workspace`](crate::openhuman::memory::people::store::for_workspace)
//! — a **workspace-keyed map** — and deliberately *not* like
//! [`memory::global`](crate::openhuman::memory::global), which is a single slot
//! holding "the one active-user workspace".
//!
//! That shape choice carries a real correctness property for free.
//! `memory::global::init` needs an explicit clear-on-failed-rebind guard so a
//! failed switch to workspace B cannot leave callers writing into workspace A.
//! With a workspace-keyed map there is no shared slot to go stale: a context
//! bound to B resolves the entry for B or falls back, and can never be handed
//! A's driver. Pinned by
//! `failed_bind_never_returns_previous_workspace_binding` in
//! `src/core/runtime/context.rs`.
//!
//! ## Two vocabularies meet here, on purpose
//!
//! [`crate::openhuman::memory::api`] is the host-owned memory contract: `MemoryProvider`,
//! `Capabilities`, `MemoryHealth`. [`crate::core::subsystem`] is the kernel's
//! *generic* driver vocabulary shared with the subsystems that come after
//! memory: `DriverClass`, `DriverCapabilities`, `DriverHealth`, `BoundDriver`.
//! This module is the adapter between them — the only place in the tree where
//! the conversion lives. `DriverClass` is reused from the kernel rather than
//! redefined here precisely because it is a *host* fact about how a driver was
//! bound, identical for every subsystem.
//!
//! The built-in driver is the compiled TinyMemory TinyBus module. The host no
//! longer exposes an embedded engine class for memory.
