//! Enforcement lint: the set of production files that reach the memory driver
//! **around** the kernel guard must not grow.
//!
//! # This test does NOT claim the guard is the only path to the driver
//!
//! It is not, and this file exists to make that measurable rather than to
//! pretend otherwise. `MemoryClient` still hands out raw, undecoratable
//! handles, all `pub(crate)` and all with live production callers:
//!
//! - `profile_store()` (`memory/store/client.rs`) — a typed `ProfileStore`
//!   over the profile/facet tables. `profile_conn()`, the raw
//!   `Arc<Mutex<rusqlite::Connection>>` it used to hand out, is now
//!   `pub(in crate::openhuman::memory)` with a single in-family caller, so
//!   every SQL statement against `user_profile` lives inside the memory
//!   family and the compiler keeps it there. **This did not put the profile
//!   tables under the guard**: the contract has no profile/facet capability
//!   family, so these reads and writes still run beneath all seven policy
//!   steps. The `.profile_store(` needle exists to keep that fact counted
//!   rather than renamed away.
//! - `memory_handle()` (`memory/store/client.rs`) — a raw `Arc<dyn Memory>`.
//!   The contract has no `Arc<dyn Memory>` door, so consumers that must satisfy
//!   a foreign trait (tinyflows, the agent-experience store) still take it.
//! - `get_document()` (`memory/store/client.rs`) — a read-one escape hatch that
//!   is driver-only by contract but not by visibility.
//!
//! What this test buys is a **ratchet**, not an invariant: the current bypasses
//! are enumerated in [`ALLOWED`] with a reason each, and that list may shrink
//! but never grow. That is deliberately weaker than "impossible to skip by
//! construction", and the weakness is the point — a lint that was red on day
//! one would be `#[ignore]`d within a week and never come back, whereas a green
//! ratchet converges. An enforcement test that overstates its own guarantee is
//! worse than none, because it stops people looking.
//!
//! Same pattern and same reasoning as `INTENTIONALLY_NOT_FORWARDED` in
//! `scripts/lib/feature-forwarding.mjs`, including its staleness half — which
//! is what stops an allowlist rotting into dead strings.
//!
//! # Known weaknesses, stated rather than hidden
//!
//! - **The lint sees text, not types.** A bypass reached through a re-export
//!   under a different name is invisible to it. Substring needles also
//!   over-match: an unrelated future `.get_document(` would trip this. That
//!   failure direction is the correct one — a false positive costs one
//!   allowlist line with a reason, a false negative costs a silent bypass.
//!   One needle has a compiler backstop: `.unguarded_provider(` is
//!   `pub(in crate::openhuman::memory)`, so even a re-export under another name
//!   cannot carry it outside the memory family. It was also *named* for the
//!   lint — `.provider(` would have over-matched `TaskSourceFilter::provider()`
//!   and `ModelRef::provider()` in four unrelated production files, costing six
//!   allowlist entries that document nothing.
//! - **By-path test files are out of scope** (`*_tests.rs`, `tests.rs`,
//!   `test_support/`). Driver tests construct drivers; that is what a driver
//!   test *is*. Allowlisting them would add ~25 entries that can never shrink
//!   and would churn on every new driver test — the exact rot this lint fights.
//! - **Inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks are NOT stripped.** Brace-tracking
//!   Rust source with a line scanner is fragile, and getting it wrong silently
//!   *hides* production sites. Four files are therefore allowlisted for a
//!   match that lives only in an inline test module; each says so.
//! - **`app/src-tauri/` is not scanned.** It links `openhuman_core` with
//!   `default-features = false` and cannot name `pub(crate)` items at all, so
//!   there is nothing there to scan. The omission is deliberate, not an
//!   oversight.
