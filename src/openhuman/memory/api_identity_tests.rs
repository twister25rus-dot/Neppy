//! The host's memory contract must **be** `tinymemory-api`, not a copy of it.
//!
//! `crate::openhuman::memory::api` is the vocabulary three parties speak:
//! the host call sites, [`crate::openhuman::modules::memory::ModuleMemoryProvider`]
//! (which serialises it onto the bus), and the separately compiled TinyMemory
//! module on the far end — which compiles against the `tinymemory-api` **crate**.
//!
//! Commit `3ee5a3cad` ("run tiny domains as TinyBus modules") inlined that
//! crate into `src/openhuman/memory/api/` as 10,894 lines of verbatim copy.
//! Every file was byte-identical to `vendor/tinymemory/api/src/` apart from
//! doc-comment paths, so nothing behaved differently on the day — but the two
//! were now *distinct types* that only a human comparing files could keep in
//! step.
//!
//! That is precisely the failure mode `modules/memory.rs` says the shared error
//! table exists to prevent: "reimplementing the mapping here is what would let
//! a `PathEscape` arrive as an `Invalid`, silently reclassifying a sandbox
//! escape as a caller mistake." `api::wire` is the table, and while the host
//! held its own copy of it that sentence described an *aspiration*, not the
//! build — the host end and the module end were two independent definitions
//! free to drift the moment either side was edited.
//!
//! These assertions are **type identities**, so they fail at compile time
//! rather than at run time. Against the inlined copy this file does not build:
//! `expected 'tinymemory_api::chunks::SourceKind', found
//! 'openhuman::openhuman::memory::api::chunks::SourceKind'`. That is the point
//! — a future re-inlining cannot land quietly, it breaks the build.
