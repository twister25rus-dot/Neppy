//! Image-tool contracts for model-facing agents.
//!
//! This module is intentionally a high-level contract layer. OpenHuman already
//! has lower-level image helpers (`image_info`, local image viewing, and
//! multimodal `[IMAGE:...]` normalization). The image layer defines the
//! stable tool names, schema, gating, and prompt guidance that agents should see
//! when a runtime can provide Codex-like media tools.
//!
//! The two first-class contracts are:
//!
//! - [`image_generation`] — create or edit raster images and return stored file
//!   references.
//! - [`image_view`] — attach a local image file as model-visible image content
//!   so the agent can inspect it.
//!
//! Keeping this contract separate from execution lets provider runtimes adopt
//! the surface incrementally without duplicating business logic in the tools
//! registry.
