//! Skill runtime: execution, cancellation, and run-log polling for installed
//! SKILL.md workflows.
//!
//! `workflows` owns discovery and installed skill metadata. `skill_registry`
//! owns remote catalogs and install sources. This module owns actually running
//! a skill, regardless of whether the skill's instructions call Python, Node,
//! shell tools, or another OpenHuman agent tool.
//!
//! ## Compile-time gate (`skills` feature)
//!
//! `pub mod skill_runtime;` is ALWAYS compiled — it is a facade. The real
//! implementation is gated behind the default-ON `skills` Cargo feature (the
//! same gate as `openhuman::skills` and `openhuman::skills::catalog` — the
//! three domains ship as one unit). When the feature is off, [`stub`] takes
//! its place with disabled-error / empty bodies. See
//! `src/openhuman/skills/mod.rs` for the pattern and the type carve-out.
