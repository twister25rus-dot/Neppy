//! Skill registry: browse, search, and install skills from the aggregated
//! Hermes catalog (HermesHub, ClawHub, skills.sh, LobeHub, browse.sh)
//! with local caching.
//!
//! ## Compile-time gate (`skills` feature)
//!
//! `pub mod skill_registry;` is ALWAYS compiled — it is a facade. The real
//! implementation is gated behind the default-ON `skills` Cargo feature (the
//! same gate as `openhuman::skills` and `openhuman::skills::runtime` — the three
//! domains ship as one unit). When the feature is off, [`stub`] takes its
//! place with no-op / empty bodies. See `src/openhuman/skills/mod.rs` for the
//! pattern and the type carve-out.
