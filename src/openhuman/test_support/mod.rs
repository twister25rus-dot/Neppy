//! Test-support domain — wipe-and-reset hooks for E2E specs.
//!
//! `openhuman.test_reset` is the one RPC E2E specs call between tests so the
//! running sidecar starts each spec from a pristine state without restarting
//! the process. As new domains add persistent state, extend `rpc::reset` to
//! wipe them too — every new domain that survives a `test_reset` is a leak
//! that will make specs interfere with each other.
//!
//! `introspect` adds read-only RPCs that let specs verify state on disk
//! and in the live process (workspace tree, files, IN_FLIGHT chat map).
