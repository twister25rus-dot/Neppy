//! MCP Registry — the host half of the user-installed server surface.
//!
//! The registry itself moved to `tinymcp`: the Smithery and official catalogs,
//! the SQLite store, the live connection map, the subprocess supervisor, the
//! browser sign-in flow, and the setup secret vault all live there now. What is
//! left here is what belongs to *this* application.
//!
//! # Modules
//!
//! - [`bus`] — the lifecycle subscriber that logs this domain's events.
//! - [`store`] — the one direct reach into the registry's store that outlives
//!   the extraction: an end-to-end test seeding the upstream response cache.
//! - [`ops`] — the `mcp_clients` RPC handlers, delegating to the service
//!   [`super::host`] holds and publishing this application's own events.
//! - [`setup_ops`] — the `mcp_setup` handlers, likewise.
//! - `schemas` — the controller schemas and dispatch.
//! - [`tools`] — the agent-facing tools.
//!
//! # The naming note still applies
//!
//! The RPC namespace and the database filename are `mcp_clients`, unchanged, so
//! existing frontend code and existing on-disk state keep working across the
//! move.
//!
//! # Types come from the contract
//!
//! Everything this module used to define — the install record, the tool shape,
//! the status summary, the catalog records — is re-exported from
//! `tinymcp_bus`. A parallel set of types here would mean a conversion at every
//! call site that nothing checks.
