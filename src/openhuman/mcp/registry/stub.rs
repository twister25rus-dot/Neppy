//! Disabled-MCP facade for [`super`] (the dynamic Smithery registry).
//!
//! Compiled only when the `mcp` Cargo feature is OFF (see the gate in
//! [`super`]). It mirrors the subset of the real `mcp::registry` public surface
//! that always-compiled callers depend on, with no-op / disabled-error /
//! empty-collection bodies so the crate still compiles, boots, and serves
//! `/rpc` without the MCP domains.
//!
//! Note what is NOT here: [`super::types`] is ungated, so this module defines
//! no data types at all — it carries behaviour only. Every type an always-on
//! caller names ([`ConnectedServerOverview`], [`McpTool`]) is the *real* one,
//! which is why the two builds cannot drift in shape.
//!
//! The signatures here MUST match the real ones exactly (return types and
//! async-ness included). The disabled build
//! (`cargo check --no-default-features`) is
//! the only thing that catches drift — if a real signature changes, update the
//! mirror below until that build is green again.
