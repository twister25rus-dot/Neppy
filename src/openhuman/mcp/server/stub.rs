//! Disabled-MCP facade for [`super`] (the OpenHuman-as-an-MCP-server surface).
//!
//! Compiled only when the `mcp` Cargo feature is OFF (see the gate in
//! [`super`]). It mirrors the subset of the real `mcp::server` public surface
//! that always-compiled callers reach, with disabled-error / empty bodies.
//!
//! [`super::tools::types`] is ungated, so [`McpToolSpec`] here is the real
//! type, not a mirrored copy — this module carries behaviour only.
//!
//! The signatures MUST match the real ones exactly (return types and
//! async-ness included). The disabled build
//! (`cargo check --no-default-features`) is
//! the only thing that catches drift.

///   transport layer.

/// Banner suppression in `cli.rs` is a `matches!` on the raw string, so it
