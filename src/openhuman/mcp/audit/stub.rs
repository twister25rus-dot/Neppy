//! Disabled-MCP facade for [`super`] (the MCP write-audit log).
//!
//! Compiled only when the `mcp` Cargo feature is OFF (see the gate in
//! [`super`]). The audit log records calls made *through the MCP server*, so
//! with MCP compiled out there is no writer and nothing to read back — the
//! disabled surface is naturally empty rather than an error.
//!
//! As in the sibling `mcp::registry` stub, [`super::types`] is ungated, so this
//! module defines no data types — only behaviour. The signatures MUST match
//! the real ones exactly; the disabled build
//! (`cargo check --no-default-features`) is
//! the only thing that catches drift.
