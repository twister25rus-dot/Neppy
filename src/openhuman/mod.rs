//! OpenHuman — a lightweight agent runtime for human-AI collaboration.
//!
//! The `openhuman` module is the heart of the agent-specific logic within the core.
//! It provides a comprehensive set of features for building and running AI agents,
//! including:
//! - **Configuration & Credentials**: Management of user settings and secure storage.
//! - **Agent Runtime**: Dispatchers, loops, and prompt management for agent execution.
//! - **Memory & Knowledge**: Systems for persistent storage and retrieval of information.
//! - **Channels & Providers**: Integrations with external platforms (Telegram, Discord, etc.).
//! - **Skills & Tools**: Extensible runtime for adding custom capabilities to agents.
//! - **Security & Monitoring**: Sandboxing, health checks, and audit logging.

// These modules define the public API surface for agent features.
// Many types/functions are intended for future use or integration with the frontend.

// no stub facade is needed — a slim build simply omits the `http_host.*` RPC
// surface (unknown-method over `/rpc`, absent from `/schema`).

// Ungated — `composio` is always compiled, `tinyflows` is behind `flows`.
pub mod json_schema;
// Ungated family root: `mcp/http_client` is always compiled, and the

// `mcp`-less build. The gate is pushed onto each member inside `mcp/mod.rs`.
pub mod mcp;
// Both children (`generation`, `image`) are wholly gated, so the parent is a
