//! Tool groups as a **library-level axis**, alongside `ServiceSet` and
//! `DomainSet`.
//!
//! The packs in [`super::registry`] exist for one host's problem: an
//! orchestrator whose fixed per-turn cost is dominated by tool schemas. That is
//! a compression decision, and compiling it in is right for the desktop app —
//! membership must not be editable by config or RPC, or a caller could move a
//! dangerous tool out of the reviewed surface.
//!
//! An embedder is a different question. `openhuman_core` is consumed as a
//! library through [`Harness`](crate::Harness), and there the pack table is not
//! a compression choice but a *capability* one: a host embedding the harness to
//! summarise documents has no use for the crypto belt at any disclosure level,
//! and a host driving its own routing may want every schema on the wire because
//! it does not pay the orchestrator's budget. Neither is expressible by
//! membership alone, which only ever answers "advertised or withheld".
//!
//! So the group id — the same string the model names in `load_skill` — becomes
//! the unit an embedder selects on, with three states rather than two:
//!
//! | [`GroupMode`] | Schemas on the wire | Registered and callable |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `Advertised` | yes | yes |
//! | `Withheld` | no (reached via `load_skill` / `use_skill`) | yes |
//! | `Off` | no | **no** |
//!
//! `Off` is the state that could not be said before, and it is the one an
//! embedder reaches for most: absence beats a registered tool that fails, for
//! the reason the `flows` compile gate already documents — a tool the model can
//! see teaches it the capability exists and makes it retry.
//!
//! **The default is exactly today's behaviour.** [`ToolGroups::default`] puts
//! every pack in `Withheld`, which is what the compiled-in table meant before
//! this type existed, so a host that never calls
//! [`CoreBuilder::tool_groups`](crate::core::runtime::CoreBuilder::tool_groups)
//! is unaffected.
//!
//! **This axis does not widen what a build contains.** A group whose tools are
//! compiled out (`--no-default-features`) or whose `DomainGroup` is off under
//! the ambient `DomainSet` stays absent no matter what mode is set here;
//! `Advertised` cannot conjure a tool that was never registered. The three
//! filters compose one way only — narrowing.
