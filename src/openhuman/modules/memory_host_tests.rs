//! Tests for the host half of the TinyMemory module's callbacks.
//!
//! Two things are worth asserting here and a third is not.
//!
//! Worth asserting: that the interfaces are actually *reachable* — served at
//! the path the module proxies, under the name the module resolves — and that
//! each Composio method reaches the host's own Composio client rather than
//! answering from something local. Both are failures that no compiler catches:
//! a name that is never claimed surfaces as `NameHasNoOwner` at the first sync
//! tick, in the field, and a method that quietly answers "nothing here" is the
//! looks-empty-rather-than-broken outcome this whole seam exists to prevent.
//!
//! Not worth asserting: what Composio replies. Every method below is driven
//! against a workspace with no session and no stored key, so the interesting
//! answer is always the *shape* of the failure — which factory it came from —
//! never a connection list. The round trips themselves are covered where they
//! can be honest, in `tinymemory`'s own module E2E against a real module.
