//! What happens to modules at startup.
//!
//! Two things, and deliberately not a third.
//!
//! Modules marked [`LoadPolicy::Eager`] are loaded, because their absence would
//! change what the core offers rather than merely delay it. Modules on the search
//! path are loaded, because that is how an operator or a developer puts an
//! artifact in front of this host without editing config — tinybus honours
//! `OPENHUMAN_MODULE_PATH` first, then the platform data directories.
//!
//! What does not happen is downloading every registry entry. A [`LoadPolicy::Lazy`]
//! module stays unloaded until something asks for it, so a user who never
//! produces a document never pays a download, a `dlopen`, or the resident cost of
//! a library that is never unloaded. Boot is also the worst moment to spend
//! network on something nobody has asked for yet.
