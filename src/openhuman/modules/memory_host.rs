//! Host-owned callbacks used by the separately compiled TinyMemory module.
//!
//! This file is the bus-served twin of `memory/host_impls.rs`. That file
//! installs the engine's seam traits as process globals, which only works while
//! the engine is compiled into this binary; these interfaces serve the same
//! capabilities to an engine that is *not*, over the module's connection.
//!
//! # Which seams are here, and why only these
//!
//! A seam earns an interface here when the capability genuinely belongs to the
//! host and the module cannot answer it from anything it was handed at load
//! time. Embedding and chat qualify because the credential, the provider
//! routing and the cost accounting all live here (see `tinymemory-module`'s
//! `embedding.rs` for the long form of that argument). Event publishing, error
//! reporting and spaCy qualify because their destinations are host subsystems.
//! Composio qualifies for the same reason one size up: the client is a *host
//! agent tool*, mode dispatch reads host config, and the OAuth session it
//! depends on is refreshed by host code.
//!
//! Seams that are *not* here are not omissions to be filled in later. The
//! module answers `ConfigLoader` from the `ModuleConfig` it was handed —
//! proxying it would mean asking the host to re-read a config the module
//! already has, with two answers free to disagree — and the scheduler gate and
//! the shutdown sequencer cannot cross a bus at all: one is synchronous, one
//! hands back a `tokio::sync::Notify`, and one takes a Rust closure.
//!
//! # The interfaces are the whole contract
//!
//! Nothing here is discoverable by the module except through the well-known
//! name it proxies. A module built against a newer contract that asks for an
//! interface an older host never served gets a name-resolution failure, which
//! is why the module side reports that failure by name rather than degrading to
//! a plausible-looking empty answer.

/// `ComposioHost`'s four trait methods each take a `&tinymemory_core::Config`.
/// That argument does not appear on any method below, and it must not: in
/// module mode it is the *engine's* config, built from the `ModuleConfig` the
/// module was loaded with, and it is not this process's `Config`. Sending it
/// would mean the host resolving a Composio client against a config the host
/// did not write and cannot trust to be current. `ChatHost` made the same call
/// — `Complete` takes a role and a request, and nothing else — and the module
/// side of that proxy simply drops the ambient context on the floor.
///
/// So the config each method here works from is the host's own, and the only
/// question is *which* host config.
///
/// # Why every method re-reads the config from disk
///
/// The install-time snapshot is the wrong answer, and quietly so. Composio's
/// state changes underneath a running process on the two events that matter
/// most: an OAuth completion in the browser, and a `set_api_key` RPC. Both
/// write config and credentials and neither restarts anything. An
/// `IsAvailable` answered from a snapshot taken at launch reports "not signed
/// in" for the rest of the session to a user who signed in a minute ago, and
/// the sync layer treats that as *skip silently* — the exact
/// looks-empty-rather-than-broken failure the seam exists to prevent.
///
/// `memory/host_impls.rs` gets liveness a cheaper way: its async methods
/// re-read from disk, and its two synchronous probes recover the caller's
/// config, which the engine's own loops keep fresh. With no caller config to
/// recover, a fresh read is what "current as of the call" costs here. It is
/// bounded — the probes sit on periodic sync paths, a handful of reads per
/// tick, next to network calls that dominate them.
///
/// The two probes cannot fail, so a config that will not load falls back to the
/// install-time snapshot rather than inventing a "no" — an unreadable config
/// file is not evidence that the user disconnected Composio.
