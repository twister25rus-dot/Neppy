//! Calling the `tinywallet` module.
//!
//! The host half of `ai.tinyhumans.tinywallet.Wallet`. Two ways to get a signed
//! transaction, and which one a chain uses is a property of that chain.
//!
//! # The confidential flow — preferred, and what BTC, EVM and Tron use
//!
//! [`sign_transaction_in_module`] sends the recovery phrase itself, once, and
//! the module derives, encodes, signs and assembles. No private key is ever
//! reassembled in this process.
//!
//! ```text
//!   host  ==SignTransaction{phrase, path, fields}==>  module   (confidential)
//!   host  <=={raw transaction, txid}================  module
//! ```
//!
//! The phrase only goes to a recipient tinybus has attested, and
//! [`attested_proxy`] additionally insists the attested digest is one
//! `registry.rs` pinned — see there for why both checks are worth having.
//!
//! # The split flow — still here, still correct for some hosts
//!
//! [`sign_transaction`] keeps the key in this process: the module returns
//! digests, this process signs them, the module reassembles.
//!
//! ```text
//!   host  --BuildUnsigned{fields, public key}-->  module
//!   host  <--[digests to sign]-------------------  module
//!   host    (signs locally, with a key the module never sees)
//!   host  --AttachSignature{fields, signatures}->  module
//!   host  <--{raw transaction, txid}-------------  module
//! ```
//!
//! It is not deprecated. It is the only option for a backend reached across a
//! transport, where the bus cannot say what is on the other end, and it is what
//! Solana still uses here — Solana hand-builds SPL messages that
//! `TransactionSpec::Solana` does not model, so there is nothing to send.
//!
//! # What the confidential flow does and does not buy
//!
//! A loaded module shares this address space and could read the phrase out of
//! process memory whichever flow is used, so neither is a hard isolation
//! boundary and neither is claimed as one.
//!
//! What changes is that this binary no longer performs derivation or signing at
//! all — the key exists only inside the module, for the duration of one call,
//! rather than being assembled here and held across two round trips. The bus
//! also refuses to carry the phrase to anything that is not an allowlisted,
//! hash-verified module, which the split flow could not express.
//!
//! # The fields are sent twice in the split flow, deliberately
//!
//! `AttachSignature` re-sends everything `BuildUnsigned` was given rather than a
//! handle to something the module remembered. That is what lets the module hold
//! no state between the calls — no store, no bound on it, no expiry for a host
//! that never comes back. Building is deterministic, so the module rebuilds the
//! transaction the digests were computed over. The confidential flow needs none
//! of this: it is one call.
//!
//! # Two signing schemes, and the difference matters
//!
//! A `Secp256k1Prehash` payload is **already hashed** and must be signed with a
//! prehash entry point; hashing it again produces a valid signature over the
//! wrong thing. An `Ed25519` payload is the whole message and must **not** be
//! pre-hashed, because ed25519 hashes internally. The module tags every payload
//! with which it is, and [`sign_payload`] dispatches on the tag rather than on
//! the chain — so a chain that changes scheme cannot silently sign wrongly.
