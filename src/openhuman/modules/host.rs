//! The module host: a broker, a connection, and the loaded-module table.
//!
//! # Why modules get their own bus
//!
//! The core already runs a bus — `core::bus::BUS`, a `OnceBus<DomainEvent>` — but
//! it cannot be reused here. `OnceBus::init_in_process` constructs its `Broker`
//! internally and never hands it out, and `ModuleHost::new` needs a `Broker` to
//! attach loaded modules to. Rather than change tinybus to expose it, modules run
//! on a second in-process broker of their own.
//!
//! That is a real limitation and worth naming: a module on this bus cannot
//! publish a `DomainEvent`, so it can serve requests but cannot participate in
//! the core's event flow. For a codec that is exactly right — a document writer
//! has nothing to say to the subconscious. A module that did need to emit events
//! would need `OnceBus` to share its broker first.
//!
//! # What loading a module means
//!
//! `dlopen` runs code before anything can inspect it. tinybus's ABI descriptor,
//! manifest and digest gates decide whether a module is *admitted*, not whether
//! it is *safe*: once loaded it can read and write this process's memory, and a
//! native fault in it takes the core down. It is first-party code that happens to
//! ship separately. tinybus also never unloads a library, so a module that fails
//! is failed until restart — which is why [`super::ops`] caches failures instead
//! of retrying.
//!
//! Everything here is created once and lives for the process. There is no
//! shutdown path because there is nothing a shutdown could reclaim.
//!
//! The broker lives on a dedicated process-lifetime Tokio runtime. This keeps a
//! module usable across short-lived caller runtimes (notably `#[tokio::test]`)
//! and also prevents an embedding host from accidentally tying module lifetime
//! to an independently managed application task runtime.
