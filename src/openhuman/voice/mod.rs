//! Voice domain — hosted speech-to-text and text-to-speech (local piper / hosted).
//!
//! Provides RPC endpoints under the `openhuman.voice_*` namespace for
//! transcription, synthesis, proactive availability checking, and a
//! standalone voice dictation server (hotkey → record → transcribe → insert).
//!
//! Inference implementations (local_speech, cloud_transcribe,
//! streaming, postprocess) now live under
//! `crate::openhuman::inference::voice` so all inference concerns share a
//! single domain root.
//!
//! ## Compile-time gate (`voice` feature)
//!
//! `pub mod voice;` is ALWAYS compiled — it is a facade. The real
//! implementation (the submodules below and the `inference::voice` re-exports)
//! is gated behind the default-ON `voice` Cargo feature. When the feature is
//! off, [`stub`] takes its place and exposes the same public surface that
//! always-on / other-gated callers depend on (`server`, `dictation_listener`,
//! `streaming`, `reply_speech`, `cloud_transcribe`, `create_stt_provider`,
//! `effective_stt_provider`, `publish_ptt_transcript_committed`) with
//! no-op / disabled-error bodies. Keeping the two surfaces in lockstep is
//! enforced by the disabled-build check
//! (`cargo check --no-default-features --features "<all-but-voice>"`): any
//! signature drift fails that build.

// Ungated — part of the always-compiled facade (see the module docs above): it
// reports which side of the gate this binary landed on, so it must exist in
// both states.
