//! The `tinyflows` capability seam: wires the `tinyflows` workflow engine
//! (an external, host-agnostic crate — validate → compile → run on its own
//! in-crate state-graph runtime) to real OpenHuman services.
//!
//! This module is export-focused. Six of the seven capability adapters plus
//! the two run entry points — [`build_capabilities`] and
//! [`open_flow_checkpointer`], re-exported below — live in [`caps`]; the
//! `memory` node's `MemoryProvider` adapter (`OpenHumanMemory`) lives in its
//! own [`memory_adapter`] module, per this repo's ~500-line file-size
//! convention (`caps.rs` is already large); the durable SQLite checkpoint
//! backend lives in [`checkpoint_sqlite`]; run observability logging lives
//! in [`observability`]; post-run Langfuse export of a run's durable graph
//! observations lives in [`langfuse_export`]. The `flows::` domain
//! (`src/openhuman/flows/ops.rs`) calls [`build_capabilities`] /
//! [`open_flow_checkpointer`] to drive a run and
//! [`langfuse_export::export_flow_run_trace`] after it settles.
