//! Host [`tinyflows::observability::RunObserver`] impls for the `flows::`
//! domain.
//!
//! `tinyflows` emits structured run/step records; the host decides what to do
//! with them. Two observers live here:
//!
//! - [`TracingRunObserver`] — log-only, for `run_with_observer` call sites and
//!   as a simple example.
//! - [`FlowRunObserver`] — the real one used by the durable run path (issue
//!   G2, live run observation). It publishes a [`DomainEvent::FlowRunProgress`]
//!   twice per non-trigger node — `running` when the node activates, then its
//!   terminal `success`/`error` when it finishes — so the frontend socket
//!   bridge can stream the run advancing node-by-node. On finish it also
//!   persists a [`FlowRunStep`] incrementally into the run's `flow_runs` row
//!   via `flows::store::upsert_flow_run_step`. All effects are best-effort: a
//!   step that fails to persist is logged, never fatal to the run.
//!
//!   The `running` half matters for more than symmetry: the canvas's
//!   `.flow-node-running` pulse is bound to that status, so while only
//!   `on_step_finish` was implemented the pulse was unreachable and the live
//!   overlay rendered as a completion trail — each node gaining a static ring
//!   only after it had already finished.
//!
//! The durable + journaled run path used by `flows_run`/`flows_resume` now
//! accepts an observer (tinyflows 0.3.1's
//! `run_with_checkpointer_journaled_observed` /
//! `resume_with_checkpointer_journaled_observed`), so [`FlowRunObserver`] sees
//! steps live instead of the run being reconstructed only after it settles.
