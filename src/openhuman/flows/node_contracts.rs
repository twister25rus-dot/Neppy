//! Host overlay on the tinyflows node-kind catalog (P1.2 / audit finding F2).
//!
//! The portable, model-level contracts live in the tinyflows crate
//! ([`tinyflows::catalog`]) — config fields, ports, examples, and the
//! structural gotchas that are true of the DSL everywhere. This module is the
//! **thin host layer**: it takes those contracts and appends the facts only
//! *this* host knows — what a `tool_call` slug resolves to (a Composio action
//! slug or an `oh:` native tool), that a Composio result is wrapped in `data`,
//! how an `agent` node receives its data (`input_context`), and which trigger
//! kinds actually dispatch here. Keeping the vendor-specific knowledge here
//! preserves tinyflows' host-agnostic invariant.
//!
//! The `list_node_kinds` / `get_node_kind_contract` agent tools and the
//! `propose_workflow` description all read the *overlaid* view via
//! [`all_node_kind_contracts`] / [`node_kind_contract`].
