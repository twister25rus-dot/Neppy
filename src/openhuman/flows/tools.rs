//! Agent-facing tool for the `flows::` domain (issue B4 — agent-first
//! Workflow authoring): [`ProposeWorkflowTool`] ("propose_workflow").
//!
//! The user asks the assistant in chat to build an automation; the agent
//! calls this tool with a candidate `tinyflows::model::WorkflowGraph`. The
//! tool runs the graph through the exact same
//! [`crate::openhuman::flows::ops::validate_and_migrate_graph`] path
//! `flows_create` uses, and returns a `workflow_proposal` summary for the
//! chat UI's `WorkflowProposalCard` — it never persists anything itself.
//!
//! **Human-in-the-loop invariant:** this tool must NEVER call
//! [`crate::openhuman::flows::ops::flows_create`] (or any other persistence
//! path). Only the user's "Save & enable" click in `WorkflowProposalCard`
//! creates the flow, via the `openhuman.flows_create` RPC directly from the
//! client. `permission_level() == PermissionLevel::None` and
//! `external_effect() == false` reflect that this call has no side effect —
//! it is pure validation.

        "Propose a candidate automation workflow for the user to review and save. This tool \
         ONLY VALIDATES the graph and returns a summary — it NEVER creates or enables the flow; \
         the user must click \"Save & enable\" in the UI before anything is persisted or can \
         run. Build a tinyflows WorkflowGraph: nodes[] ({id, kind, name, config}) + edges[] \
         ({from_node, to_node, from_port?, to_port?}; ports default \"main\"). For a branching \
         node (condition/switch), the branch label goes on from_port — NEVER on to_port \
         (to_port just stays \"main\"); routing is keyed exclusively on from_port, so a label \
         on to_port instead silently turns the branch into an unconditional fan-out and is a \
         hard reject. Exactly ONE \
         trigger node is required. The 22 node kinds: trigger (config.trigger_kind: manual | \
         schedule | webhook | app_event | form | chat_message | evaluation | system | \
         execute_by_workflow; schedule needs config.schedule = {kind:\"cron\",expr,tz?} | \
         {kind:\"at\",at} | {kind:\"every\",every_ms}; app_event needs config.toolkit + \
         config.trigger_slug), agent (config.prompt), tool_call (config.slug REQUIRED + \
         config.args), http_request (config.method/url, optional headers/body), code \
         (config.language: \"javascript\"|\"python\" + config.source), shell (exactly one of \
         config.source or config.script_path; optional config.interpreter: \"sh\"|\"bash\", \
         config.cwd, config.env; this host rejects execution until it has a policy-aware shell \
         capability), condition (config.field; \
         routes on from_port \"true\"/\"false\", e.g. {from_node:\"gate\",from_port:\"true\",\
         to_node:\"x\",to_port:\"main\"}), switch (config.expression or config.field; routes to \
         the matching case port, or \"default\"), transform (config.set: {key: \"=expr\"} \
         merged onto each item), split_out (config.path to an array field; fans out one item per \
         element), merge (fan-in passthrough, no config), output_parser (passthrough today; no \
         config required), sub_workflow (config.workflow: an embedded child WorkflowGraph), \
         memory (config.operation REQUIRED: recall | search | flavour | people | remember | \
         forget; config.scope for recall/remember/forget: \"user\" is READ-ONLY, \"flow\" is \
         this flow's own memory and the ONLY scope remember/forget may target, \"flows\" is \
         cross-flow READ-ONLY; config.query for recall/search; config.flavour for the flavour \
         slug; config.key/config.value for remember/forget. Place remember AFTER the real \
         action it records, never before, so a failed action never marks an item as done), \
         dedup (config.key REQUIRED: an \"=expr\" per-item key, e.g. \"=item.id\"; drops an item \
         whose key was already committed by a PRIOR successful run, else passes it through. Use \
         this — not a memory recall/condition graph — for exact \"process each item once\": \
         place it right after the item source and before the action, e.g. split_out → dedup → \
         …action…), \
         loop (optional config.max_iterations, positive, default 25; optional config.on_exceeded: \
         \"error\" (default, fails the run) | \"continue\" (stop looping, leave via `done`); \
         optional config.condition \"=expr\" for an early exit. Emits on the `body` port while \
         it keeps looping and on `done` when it stops; CLOSE THE LOOP by wiring the body's last \
         node back to the loop node. The pass number is readable as \
         \"=nodes.<loop id>.iteration\". The `body` must ROUTE BACK to the loop node, not merely \
         leave it. A fan-in `merge` must not sit on the cycle, and the loop node must not itself \
         be a fan-in — join before it instead), \
         spawn (config.target REQUIRED: workflow | tool | http — starts work WITHOUT waiting \
         and emits an opaque ticket, so the branch carries on; target=tool needs config.slug + \
         config.args, target=workflow needs config.workflow, target=http needs config.request. \
         Pass the ticket to a `gate`; never interpret it. A spawn no gate collects simply runs \
         — wire it into a `void` to say that on purpose), \
         gate (the collecting half of spawn: config.from = ids of the spawn nodes to wait on, \
         or config.tickets \"=expr\"; optional config.release: \"all\" (default) | \"any\" | \
         \"first_n\" | \"quorum\" | \"timeout_partial\", with config.n REQUIRED and > 0 for \
         first_n/quorum; optional config.wait_mode: \"poll\" (default) | \"suspend\". EVERY \
         poll costs a super-step, so a long wait wants \"suspend\", not a big max_polls), \
         scatter (fans the whole DOWNSTREAM PATH into parallel lanes, not just the immediate \
         successors: scatter → enrich → score → gather runs that pipeline once per lane. \
         Optional config.path to an array to fan out over, else the node's own input items are \
         the lanes; optional config.lanes to chunk into at most N lanes, clamped to 256. MUST \
         reach a `gather`, and lane nodes are read as \"=nodes.<id>.lanes.<lane>\", NOT \
         \"=nodes.<id>.item\". A nested scatter, a loop head, or requires_approval inside a \
         lane are each rejected), \
         gather (collects the lanes: config.from REQUIRED = ids of the lane-terminal nodes; same \
         config.release/config.n policies as gate; optional config.on_lane_error: \"collect\" \
         (default) | \"skip\" | \"fail_fast\". Output is ordered by lane index, not by finish \
         order), \
         approval (a HUMAN review step, distinct from requires_approval: optional config.subject \
         or \"=expr\", config.subject_kind, config.title, config.prompt, config.assignees, and \
         config.metadata; routes the verdict as data on \"approved\" / \"rejected\". With no \
         host review provider it parks the run and is settled through flows_resume), \
         void (terminal sink, no config: accepts items, discards them, runs nothing downstream. \
         Says \"this branch is a side effect and nothing waits on it\" where an unwired port \
         would read like a forgotten one. An outgoing edge is a hard reject, and so is having \
         no incoming edge; it adds NO concurrency — use spawn for that). If \
         validation fails, fix the graph and call this tool again."
