//! The `flows::` domain: saved automation workflows (tinyflows graphs) —
//! create/get/list/update/delete/enable/run, backed by SQLite. Mirrors
//! `src/openhuman/cron/`'s module shape.
//!
//! Business logic lives in [`ops`]; persistence in `store` (private, with a
//! handful of functions re-exported below for the capability seam's
//! [`crate::openhuman::flows::tinyflows::caps::FlowStateStore`]); the RPC/CLI
//! controller surface in `schemas` (private, re-exported below).
//!
//! [`medulla_bridge`] adapts this store onto the medulla harness protocol's
//! workflow plane, so a remote orchestrator can read these graphs and brief the
//! authoring copilot without any of that reaching back into `ops`.
//!
//! # Gate shape — leaf, not facade
//!
//! The whole family (this module plus [`tinyflows`]) is gated at
//! `pub mod flows;` in `src/openhuman/mod.rs` on `#[cfg(feature = "flows")]`,
//! and the submodules below inherit that gate. There is **no `stub.rs`**:
//! every symbol reached from outside is a *registration site* (`core::all`,
//! `core::jsonrpc`'s `FlowTriggerSubscriber`, `core::runtime::services`' boot
//! reconcile, the agent-tool `vec!` in `tools::ops`, the `workflow_builder` /
//! `flow_discovery` entries in `agent_registry`), and a registration site wants
//! *absence*, not a disabled-error stub — otherwise `flows.*` becomes a known
//! method that fails at runtime.
//!
//! The leaf gate holds only because no always-compiled domain has a real code
//! edge into this tree. `memory/tools.rs` and `memory/tools/flavour.rs` name
//! `flows::tinyflows` in **comments only**. If either ever becomes a real
//! `use`, this family must convert to the facade+stub shape (see `voice/`).
