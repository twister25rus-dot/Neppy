//! Agent tools giving a running flow a private, sandboxed memory namespace
//! (`flow_<flow_id>` — see [`flow_namespace`]).
//!
//! Motivating use case: a newsletter-digest flow that runs on a schedule
//! needs to remember which items it already sent so it doesn't re-send them
//! on the next run. Without a durable, flow-scoped place to note "already
//! sent: <item id>", the agent node inside the flow has no way to dedupe
//! across runs other than re-deriving state from the target service itself
//! (which is often lossy or rate-limited).
//!
//! **Security invariant (non-negotiable):** there is no code path here by
//! which a flow can write to — or even name — a namespace other than its
//! own. [`FlowMemoryRememberTool`] derives the namespace internally via
//! [`flow_namespace`] from the caller-supplied `flow_id`; there is no
//! `namespace` parameter a caller could override. Every write is tainted
//! [`MemoryTaint::ExternalSync`] (automation output, not user-authored
//! fact), matching the same taint sync pipelines use for third-party
//! content, so the subconscious gate treats it exactly as conservatively.
//! [`FlowMemoryRecallTool`]'s `scope: "flows"` is read-only cross-flow
//! visibility — it can never be used to write outside a flow's own
//! namespace either.
//!
//! **T-M2 fix:** [`FlowMemoryRememberTool`] only resolves the flow id from
//! the run's own trusted `TrustedAutomation { Workflow }` turn origin (see
//! [`trusted_flow_id`]) — it never trusts a model-supplied `flow_id` arg.
//! Outside a trusted workflow run (every chat/orchestrator turn) the write
//! is refused outright, not routed to whatever `flow_id` the caller named.

    // `tinymemory_api::types::{MemoryCategory, MemoryTaint}` verbatim
    // (tinymemory#18 §A1 moved them onto the contract so a second engine could
    // be bound without translating). Naming them at the contract keeps the
    // alias honest and is one fewer reason this file holds the crate (#5560).
    use crate::openhuman::memory::api::types::{
        MemoryCategory as EngineCategory, MemoryTaint as EngineTaint,

    // ── Why `UnifiedMemory` is still here, and what replacing it costs (#5560)
    //
    // This whole module is `#[cfg(test)]`, so the engine is not linked into a
    // production build from this file; the crate survives #5560 as a
    // dev-dependency and this is the kind of fixture that keeps it. What the
    // fixture cannot do is move to the bound driver in a one-line swap, and
    // there are two independent reasons worth recording before someone tries.
    //
    // 1. **The seam is a different trait.** `test_mem` hands back
    //    `Arc<dyn memory::Memory>` (= `tinymemory_api::traits::Memory`), and
    //    `Arc<dyn MemoryProvider>` does not coerce to it: `MemoryProvider`'s
    //    supertrait is `MemoryCore`, which is a *different* trait with taint as
    //    an argument rather than a second method (see `provider/mandatory.rs`,
    //    which says so at the definition). Rebinding the fixture onto
    //    `memory::test_support::install_tinycortex_for_test` therefore rewrites
    //    every `mem.store_with_taint(..)` / `mem.get(..)` in this module, not
    //    just its two lines.
    // 2. **The backend choice is load-bearing.** `FLOW_MEMORY_NAMESPACE_PREFIX`'s
    //    doc above turns on `UnifiedMemory::sanitize_namespace` disagreeing with
    //    `Memory::forget`'s raw `WHERE namespace = ?1`. A volatile stand-in such
    //    as `tinycortex::memory::store::InMemoryMemoryStore` implements the same
    //    `Memory` trait and would compile, but it does not reproduce that
    //    inconsistency — so it would quietly stop testing the property the
    //    prefix exists to satisfy.
    //
    // Every test below that touches `test_mem` is already `#[ignore]`d, and
    // their ignore reason is the deeper problem: the tools resolve the *bound
    // driver*, so a store seeded here is not the store they read. Making them
    // coherent again is a fixture rewrite against the binding — a change worth
    // making on its own, with the tests un-ignored so the result is verified,
    // not folded into a dependency-shedding pass.
