//! Egress spine (privacy epic S2, #4436).
//!
//! Centralizes "what leaves, to where, why" for every external data transfer.
//! See [`types`] for the [`EgressDescriptor`] contract and [`emit`] for the
//! single publish chokepoint. Consumed by the web bridge
//! ([`crate::openhuman::web_chat`]) which surfaces the
//! descriptor to the frontend, and by later privacy slices (disclosure S3,
//! approval S4, identification-risk detector S5, enforcement S7).
