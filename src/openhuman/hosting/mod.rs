//! Hosting: putting a workspace on the internet.
//!
//! This domain is the seam between OpenHuman and [`tinyhosts`], the unified
//! hosting API. TinyHosts owns everything about a provider — Vercel's endpoints,
//! its deployment protocol, how a marketplace database is provisioned and
//! connected. This module owns everything about *OpenHuman*: where the
//! credential comes from, which directory an agent is allowed to deploy, and how
//! the result is described back to a model.
//!
//! The split is the point. Nothing here knows the word "project" or
//! "readyState", and nothing in `tinyhosts` knows what a workspace is.
//!
//! # What the agent gets
//!
//! Nine tools, in [`tools`]. `hosting_launch_site` is the one that matters: it
//! turns a directory in the workspace into a live site with a database behind
//! it. `hosting_rollback` is its counterweight — it points production back at
//! an earlier deployment, so an agent that ships a broken site has a way back
//! rather than only a way forward. The rest read or adjust what they produced.
//!
//! # The credential
//!
//! [`Account::from_config`] resolves one from `[hosting].api_key`, falling back
//! to the provider's own environment variables. It returns `Ok(None)` — not an
//! error — when hosting is switched off or no credential resolves, and the
//! registry then does not register the tools at all. A tool that is present and
//! cannot work is worse than one that is absent: a model will retry it.
