//! The workflow plane of the medulla harness protocol: advertising this host's
//! saved workflow graphs, and serving the reads (and the one authoring turn)
//! the orchestrator round-trips back to whoever owns them.
//!
//! **Why a trait and not a direct call into `flows`.** Two different hosts embed
//! this transport — openhuman over its SQLite `flows` store, and medulla-public
//! over its own layered JSON workflow store — and they share nothing but the
//! wire shape. So the store side is a host-supplied [`WorkflowBridge`] the host
//! installs once at startup ([`set_workflow_bridge`]), and the engine types stay
//! entirely on the host's side of the seam: a graph, a node-kind catalog and a
//! run list all cross as opaque [`serde_json::Value`], exactly as they do in
//! medulla-v1's `WorkflowCatalog` port. Nothing in this module parses a node, an
//! edge, or a config field.
//!
//! **Why every path answers.** The server correlates a request by `requestId`
//! and waits on a deadline — ten seconds for a read, ten *minutes* for a copilot
//! turn. A dropped request is therefore not a cheap no-op: it burns that whole
//! window and, for `copilot`, holds a promise open for the rest of the cycle. So
//! a missing bridge, an unknown op argument, a bridge error and even a panicking
//! bridge method all become a `medulla:workflow_result` with `ok: false` and a
//! readable message. The only way to stay silent is for the socket to be gone,
//! which the server already handles by retiring the waiter on disconnect.
