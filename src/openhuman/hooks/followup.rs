//! Follow-up messages injected by `stop` hooks.
//!
//! A `stop` hook can answer with `followup_message`, asking for one more turn —
//! "you did not run the tests, run them". The hook fires *after* the turn has
//! already returned to its caller, so the message cannot re-enter the turn that
//! produced it. It is queued here instead, and the entrypoint that owns the
//! conversation decides whether to spend another turn on it.
//!
//! That indirection is not an implementation shortcut. Only the entrypoint
//! knows whether there is still a user attached: a chat turn can be extended,
//! a cron run that has already reported its result cannot, and a channel turn
//! that has flushed its reply would surprise the recipient. A queue lets each
//! answer for itself, and lets a host that answers "no" simply never drain it.
//!
//! [`HookEngine`](super::engine::HookEngine)'s `loop_limit` accounting has
//! already been charged by the time a message lands here, so a drain loop
//! cannot spin: a hook that keeps asking runs out of budget.
