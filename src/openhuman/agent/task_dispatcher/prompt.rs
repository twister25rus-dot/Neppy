//! Task prompt construction — a thin binding of
//! [`tinyagents::graph::todos::dispatch::prompt`] to OpenHuman's tool names.
//!
//! The crate owns the rendering (objective, plan, acceptance criteria, source
//! provenance, and the "block rather than guess" progress addendum). All this
//! module supplies is which tools the generated text should point the model at:
//! `memory_recall` for the ingested activity of a card's originating item, and
//! `update_task` for the card write-back.
