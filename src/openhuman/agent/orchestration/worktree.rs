//! Git-worktree isolation for parallel, edit-capable agent workers.
//!
//! Parallel coding workers spawned via [`super::tools::spawn_parallel_agents`]
//! historically shared one workspace (`Config.action_dir`). Two workers editing
//! overlapping files left the parent with stale assumptions and silent
//! clobbers. Each isolated worker instead gets its own `git worktree` checkout
//! of the **user's project repo** (the directory the coding agent edits), so
//! file edits never collide.
//!
//! ## Where the implementation lives
//!
//! The git plumbing itself is **TinyAgents'**
//! ([`tinyagents::harness::workspace::git`]): worktree create/list/status/diff/
//! remove, repo-root validation, run-id sanitizing, and cross-worker overlap
//! detection are host-agnostic and are re-exported here under their historical
//! OpenHuman names so call sites and the RPC surface are unchanged.
//!
//! What stays in OpenHuman is the part that depends on *this* host: the
//! [`OpenHumanWorktreeIsolation`] adapter, which stamps an
//! `openhuman.worktree:{agent}:{run_id}` policy id onto prepared descriptors and
//! announces workspace lifecycle on the OpenHuman event bus so audit and
//! observability subscribers can correlate an isolated run with its allowed
//! root.
//!
//! ## Scope and safety
//!
//! - This targets the **user's project repository** rooted at the agent's
//!   `action_dir` — it never operates on OpenHuman's own source tree.
//! - Every operation validates that `repo_root` is a real git repository
//!   first (via `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`), so a stray path can
//!   never be mutated.
//! - [`remove`] refuses to delete a **dirty** worktree unless `force = true`.
//!   Clean worktrees can be auto-reclaimed; dirty ones require an explicit
//!   user decision (acceptance criterion of #3376).
//!
//! The wrapper shells out to `git` through [`std::process::Command`] with an
//! explicit, validated working directory. It does not inherit ambient git
//! configuration that could redirect operations elsewhere.
