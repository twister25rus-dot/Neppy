//! Background agent command center (issue #3373).
//!
//! A read-only product surface over the durable run ledger
//! (`tinyagents::session::run_ledger`): it lists recent background agent runs grouped by
//! a normalized status model (needs-input / working / completed / failed /
//! stopped) so users can see what is in flight, what is blocked on them, and
//! what finished. Live run state already persists to the ledger via the spawn
//! tools + `web_chat::progress_bridge`; this module only
//! projects and groups it for display.
//!
//! Control verbs (stop / retry / continue / follow-up) live in [`control`]:
//! durable run-ledger transitions exposed over `openhuman.agent_work_control`.
