//! Team-member execution as a conditional-routing `tinyagents` graph (#4249, B2).
//!
//! This is the `agent_teams` folder's `graph.rs` per the per-folder graph
//! convention: the folder's tinyagents graph definition (member-run state
//! machine) lives here; `runtime.rs` drives it.
//!
//! A teammate's live run is a small state machine: **execute** the worker
//! sub-agent, then route on its terminal outcome to **complete** (quality-gate +
//! idle) or **fail** (release + idle + record), joining at a single **done**
//! finish node. Historically this was a hand-rolled `match` in
//! [`super::runtime::drive_member`]; here it is a real `tinyagents`
//! [`CompiledGraph`] with command-routing:
//!
//! ```text
//!              ┌─ complete ─┐
//!   execute ──►┤            ├─► done (finish)
//!              └─ fail ─────┘
//! ```
//!
//! The worker run and the two reconciliation effects are **injected** as
//! closures so the graph mechanics (conditional routing + the engine-error
//! propagation contract) are unit-testable with trivial stubs while production
//! passes the real `spawn_agent`/`wait_agents` + run-ledger writes.
//!
//! Error contract (preserved from the legacy `drive_member`): `run_worker`
//! returns `Err` only for engine-internal failures (spawn/wait) — those
//! propagate out of the graph so the caller releases the task and idles the
//! member. A worker that *ran* but did not complete is a normal `Failed`
//! outcome handled by `on_failed`, which returns `Ok`.
