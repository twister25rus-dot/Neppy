//! `FacetCache` — thin wrapper over `user_profile_facets` for Phase 3.
//!
//! Provides typed read/write access to the facet table with class-aware helpers.
//! The stability detector uses this to persist the result of each rebuild cycle.
//! Prompt sections use [`FacetCache::list_active`] to read the ambient cache.
