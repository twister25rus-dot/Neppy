//! [`ChatHistory`] over OpenHuman's durable `session_raw` transcript.
//!
//! This is the seam chosen in `docs/specs/2026-07-28-agent-session-transcript-to-tinyagents-design.md`
//! §4 Option A: the harness talks to the crate's
//! [`tinyagents::harness::memory::ChatHistory`] trait, while OpenHuman keeps
//! ownership of the on-disk format. Nothing about `session_raw` moves, so
//! there is no on-disk change and no migration risk — the previous parallel
//! abstraction is what goes away.
//!
//! [`SessionTranscriptHistory`] is a thin handle over the free functions in
//! [`super::transcript`]. It holds no state beyond the transcript's identity,
//! so it is cheap to construct per turn and safe to share.
//!
//! # Why the trait's `thread_id` is not used for path resolution
//!
//! `ChatHistory` is keyed by `thread_id`, but a `session_raw` transcript is
//! keyed by its **stem** (`{unix_ts}_{agent_id}`, or `{parent_chain}__…` for a
//! sub-agent). These are deliberately different: several transcripts can share
//! one `_meta.thread_id` — every sub-agent spawned within a thread does — so
//! resolving a path from `thread_id` would be ambiguous and could interleave
//! two agents' histories into one file.
//!
//! The handle is therefore bound to one transcript at construction, and the
//! `thread_id` argument is accepted for trait conformance only. Callers that
//! genuinely want thread-level lookup use
//! [`super::transcript::find_root_transcript_for_thread`].
//!
//! # Append-only, including `clear`
//!
//! Every mutation routes through
//! [`append_transcript_turn`][super::transcript::append_transcript_turn], which
//! never rewrites existing lines. A reduction in the logical message set
//! becomes a `{"kind":"compaction","replacement":[…]}` record rather than a
//! file rewrite. That includes [`SessionTranscriptHistory::clear`] — see its
//! doc comment for the semantics that were chosen and why.
//!
//! # Why the metadata-bearing write does not cross the crate trait
//!
//! S4 of the design doc is worded as "the turn path takes `Arc<dyn
//! ChatHistory>`", but that wording conflicts with S4's own exit criterion
//! ("`threads/transcript_view` projection output unchanged"). The crate trait
//! (`vendor/tinyagents/src/harness/memory/types.rs`) has exactly four methods,
//! and every one of them carries only a `thread_id: &str` plus `Message` /
//! `Vec<Message>`. Three things the turn path persists therefore have **no
//! channel**:
//!
//! - **`request_id`** — stamped on every line of a turn. It drives
//!   `DisplayItem::TurnBoundary` (`threads/transcript_view/project.rs`,
//!   `maybe_emit_turn_boundary`) and the `(request_id, ts)` root-turn segments
//!   that anchor every `DisplayItem::Subagent`. Lose it and the transcript view
//!   silently stops showing turn structure.
//! - **`turn_usage`** — attributed to the last assistant row. It carries
//!   `model`, `iteration`, `ts`, `reasoning_content` and the native
//!   `tool_calls`. The projection reads **every** `DisplayItem::ToolCall` off
//!   `turn_usage.tool_calls`, so losing it does not degrade the tool rows, it
//!   deletes them — after which each following `role:"tool"` line falls through
//!   to the orphan branch. `Reasoning` items vanish with it, and
//!   `AssistantMessage.{model,iteration}` / `interim` collapse.
//! - **`TranscriptMeta`'s cumulative fields** — `turn_count` and the four
//!   token/cost rollups that `read_thread_usage_summary` (`threads/ops.rs`)
//!   reports. The turn path computes these fresh each turn;
//!   [`SessionTranscriptHistory::meta_for_write`] deliberately re-reads the
//!   file's existing `_meta` instead, which is right for the generic trait path
//!   but would freeze the rollups at the previous turn's values if the turn
//!   path used it.
//!
//! So the turn path goes through [`SessionHistory::append_turn`] — an
//! OpenHuman-side supertrait of `ChatHistory` whose one method forwards the
//! same six arguments `append_transcript_turn` already takes. The indirection
//! is real (`Arc<dyn SessionHistory>`), the on-disk bytes are unchanged by
//! construction, and `ChatHistory` stays in the bound so the handle is still a
//! genuine crate-side history for any future consumer.
//!
//! ## Two alternatives, rejected — recorded so they are not re-litigated
//!
//! 1. **Per-message `ChatHistory::append`.** One `append_transcript_turn` per
//!    message means one `_meta` line and one full-file re-read per message:
//!    an on-disk change *and* O(n²) I/O on a file that grows without bound.
//! 2. **Widening `ChatHistory` upstream.** It does not close the gap either.
//!    The crate's `Usage` has no `cost_usd` / `context_window`;
//!    `TranscriptMeta` is a cumulative *file header*, not turn provenance; and
//!    the per-message tool-failure `extra_metadata` that
//!    `message_to_chat_message` drops is untouchable by any turn-level record.
//!    You would pay a tinyagents release and still need a
//!    `serde_json::Value` escape hatch, for a trait that has no consumer inside
//!    the vendored crate outside `harness/memory/`.
//!
//! # Why the READ half is [`SessionTranscriptRead`], not `ChatHistory::messages`
//!
//! Same shape of argument as the write, and equally settled — measured with a
//! round-trip probe, not assumed. `ChatHistory::messages` returns
//! `Vec<Message>`, and the turn path needs `Vec<ChatMessage>` back, so a
//! trait-mediated read has to pass through
//! [`message_to_chat_message`][crate::openhuman::agent::message_convert::message_to_chat_message].
//! That converter maps `Message::Assistant` to `ChatMessage::assistant(msg.text())`
//! and **drops `a.tool_calls` entirely**. A persisted native tool round is
//! deliberately stored as the `{content, tool_calls}` / `{tool_call_id, content}`
//! envelope so the next turn re-parses it; flattening it orphans every following
//! `role:"tool"` row and produces the provider `400 An assistant message with
//! 'tool_calls' must be followed by tool messages`. It also blinds the
//! TAURI-RUST-7 trailing strip in
//! [`bound_cached_transcript_messages`][super::types::Agent::bound_cached_transcript_messages],
//! which sniffs that envelope out of `ChatMessage.content`. Two lesser losses
//! ride along and are inert on this path: the `openhuman_turn_usage`
//! `extra_metadata` (re-attached by `read_transcript`, never re-serialised from
//! the cached prefix) and `AssistantMessage.id` (no reader anywhere).
//!
//! So the read goes through [`SessionTranscriptRead::read_session`], which
//! returns the very [`SessionTranscript`] the free function returns, produced by
//! the same [`read_transcript`] call. Losslessness is **structural**: nothing
//! crosses `Message`, so `tool_calls`, `tool_call_id`, `failure`,
//! `reasoning_content` and the `_meta` header all survive by construction, and
//! compaction replay + `interrupted: true` partial skipping stay exactly where
//! the format owner performs them.
//!
//! # Why discovery is a separate object ([`SessionHistoryLocator`])
//!
//! A handle is bound to one *file*. The turn path's two reads are *lookups*:
//! `(workspace, session_raw_subdir, agent name)` → newest match, and
//! `_meta.thread_id` → newest **root** transcript. `ChatHistory` has no
//! discovery concept at all (it is `thread_id`-keyed and returns messages, never
//! a location), so leaving discovery as free functions would keep the read half
//! hitting the filesystem no matter what handle was injected — i.e. the
//! `Arc<dyn …>` would stay decorative. The locator is therefore the single
//! injected object covering *both* reads and the session's own write handle.
//!
//! # Deliberately NOT done here — recorded with reasons
//!
//! - **The `impl ChatHistory` block below still has no production caller.**
//!   Reads go through `read_session`, writes through `append_turn`. It is kept,
//!   not deleted, because it is the crate-side seam Option A exists to
//!   establish, and because it supplies the `Send + Sync + 'static` bounds the
//!   shared `Arc<dyn SessionHistory>` needs. The trigger that would delete it is
//!   an explicit decision to drop `ChatHistory` from the [`SessionHistory`]
//!   bound; that frees this file's `read`/`persisted`/`meta_for_write`/
//!   `write_logical_set`/`impl ChatHistory` (~150 lines) plus most of the test
//!   module (~570 lines together). Decide it, don't rediscover it.
//! - **The spec's "Removes: ~400 LOC of parallel abstraction" is not delivered
//!   and cannot be.** See the design doc's "Where '~400 LOC' came from"
//!   subsection: the figure is §2.1's residual after Option B, i.e. exactly
//!   `migration.rs` (373 LOC), which §5 S1 and the deletion ledger both keep
//!   host-owned. Option A's measured ledger is ≈ −15 / +90 LOC here.
//! - **The #4249 JSONL↔store mirror is the one genuine parallel session
//!   persistence** (`session_import/live.rs`, `maybe_shadow_read_session_store`
//!   / `maybe_dual_write_session_store`, the `StoreRegistry` registration, two
//!   `AgentConfig` flags, one config migration — ~565 prod LOC). It is not
//!   touched here: it is gated on #4249's own Phase-2 parity soak and its
//!   terminus (reads served from the store) points the opposite way from this
//!   branch's non-negotiable zero-on-disk-change constraint.
