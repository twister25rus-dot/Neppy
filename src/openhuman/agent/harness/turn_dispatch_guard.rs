//! Turn-scoped guard that decides whether a **new sub-agent dispatch can still
//! succeed** before it is attempted.
//!
//! # The failure this exists to prevent
//!
//! A turn that reaches its model-call cap asks the harness to stop gracefully
//! ([`CapPauser`](crate::openhuman::agent::tinyagents::observability), which
//! sends `SteeringCommand::Pause`) so the caller can summarise a resumable
//! checkpoint instead of erroring. That command is **advisory**: it is honoured
//! at the harness loop boundary, and nothing consulted it before dispatching a
//! new sub-agent. A dispatch issued in the same instant as the pause request
//! then runs as a tool call wrapped by the run's *remaining* wall-clock budget
//! (`run_policy_for`'s `max_wall_clock_ms`). When that remainder is smaller
//! than the child needs, the harness raises `TinyAgentsError::Timeout` for the
//! whole run — and every result the turn had accumulated is discarded rather
//! than checkpointed. The mechanism designed to degrade gracefully became the
//! cause of the hard failure (issue #5804).
//!
//! # What this guard does
//!
//! It records two facts a turn already knows but never wrote down, and turns
//! them into a decision at the one chokepoint every synchronous delegation
//! passes through (`subagent_runner::ops::runner::run_subagent`):
//!
//! 1. **Has a graceful pause been requested?** Once it has, further fan-out
//!    cannot help: the loop is going to stop at its next boundary regardless,
//!    so a child dispatched now can only burn budget the checkpoint needs.
//! 2. **Is there still enough wall-clock left for a dispatch to finish?**
//!    Judged against what *this turn's own* sub-agents have actually taken —
//!    never a configured constant.
//!
//! # Scope semantics
//!
//! Installed as a `tokio::task_local` around the parent's turn future, next to
//! [`turn_subagent_usage`](super::turn_subagent_usage) and with deliberately
//! identical visibility rules. The line is **same task or not**, which is not
//! the same line as serial or parallel:
//!
//! * **Serial delegation** (`spawn_subagent` → `run_subagent`) runs inline on
//!   the turn's task and is covered.
//! * **Parallel fan-out is also covered.** `spawn_parallel_agents` drives its
//!   workers through `tinyagents::graph::parallel::map_reduce`, which bounds
//!   concurrency with `futures`' `buffer_unordered`
//!   (`vendor/tinyagents/src/graph/parallel/mod.rs:86`) rather than
//!   `tokio::spawn`. `buffer_unordered` polls every worker on the **caller's**
//!   task, so each one inherits this task-local and passes the same gate. Its
//!   serial fallback for shared-workspace writes is covered for the obvious
//!   reason. Both call `run_subagent`
//!   (`openhuman:src/openhuman/agent/orchestration/spawn_parallel_graph.rs:1386`).
//! * **Detached background sub-agents** (`spawn_async_subagent`) run on tasks
//!   that do not inherit the task-local, deliberately — their spend already
//!   completes after the parent's `chat_done` and is accounted globally, the
//!   same carve-out `turn_subagent_usage` makes.
//!
//! [`current`] returns `None` outside any scope (CLI, direct invocation,
//! tests), and **every read degrades to "allow"** — this guard can only ever
//! refuse a dispatch it has positive evidence against, so a missing scope
//! restores exactly the previous behaviour.
