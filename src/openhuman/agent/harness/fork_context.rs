//! Task-local plumbing that lets `SpawnSubagentTool` reach the parent
//! agent's runtime context (provider, tools, model, …) without widening
//! the [`crate::openhuman::tools::Tool`] trait.
//!
//! [`PARENT_CONTEXT`] is set by the parent
//! [`crate::openhuman::agent::Agent`] around its `turn` so that any tool
//! executing inside that turn (in particular `spawn_subagent`) can read
//! the parent's provider, tool list, and model information.
//!
//! Stashed in `Arc`s so cloning into a child costs a refcount bump
//! rather than a full copy.
