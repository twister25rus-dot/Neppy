//! Filesystem-offload convention for worker artifacts on long-horizon tasks
//! (#3883).
//!
//! **The mechanics now live in
//! [`tinyagents::harness::artifacts`]** — thresholds, path resolution, pointer
//! rendering, the symlink re-check, and the writer itself. This module is what
//! `plan-agents.md` Phase 5 leaves behind: the wiring, plus the two halves that
//! are genuinely OpenHuman's.
//!
//! ## What stayed, and why
//!
//! * **[`contract`] — the prompt half.** It is OpenHuman prompt text naming
//!   OpenHuman tools, which `plan-agents.md` §6 lists as not publishable. The
//!   crate's [`render_artifact_pointer`] takes the read-tool name as a
//!   parameter for the same reason, and [`READ_TOOL`] is what OpenHuman passes.
//! * **[`policy`] — the two host policies.** `SecurityPolicy`'s workspace
//!   containment and `sanitize_text`'s credential scrubbing. The crate asks;
//!   these answer.
//!
//! ## The convention
//!
//! Two directories under the agent's existing `action_dir`:
//!
//! | Directory               | Holds                                                    |
//! | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
//! | `action_dir/outputs/`   | Deliverables. Handed between steps **by path**.          |
//! | `action_dir/workspace/` | Scratch. Intermediate files not meant to be handed back. |
//!
//! A worker that produces a large result writes it to `outputs/` and returns
//! the path plus a short abstract. Context stays lean and the full artifact is
//! recoverable with an ordinary `file_read`.
//!
//! Two halves enforce it:
//!
//! * **Prompt** — [`render_artifact_offload_contract`] is appended to every
//!   typed sub-agent's system prompt, so workers offload on purpose.
//! * **Harness** — [`offload_oversized_result`] runs on every sub-agent
//!   outcome, so an oversized result is offloaded even when the worker inlined
//!   it anyway.
//!
//! The summarizer detour
//! ([`crate::openhuman::agent::tinyagents::payload_summarizer`]) and the
//! `tool_result_budget_bytes` truncation stay exactly as they are: they are the
//! **fallback** for anything this convention does not catch, and for every
//! failure mode here — a refused path, a full disk — the caller keeps its
//! inline payload and falls through to them.
