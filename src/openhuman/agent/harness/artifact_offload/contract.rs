Large results belong on disk, not in your reply. Two directories sit under your action directory:\n\
- `{OUTPUTS_DIR}/` for deliverables, anything the parent or a later step needs to read.\n\
- `{SCRATCH_DIR}/` for scratch, intermediate files you do not intend to hand back.\n\
\n\
When a result would run past roughly {CONTRACT_THRESHOLD_TOKENS} tokens:\n\
1. Write the full content to a file under `{OUTPUTS_DIR}/` with `{OFFLOAD_WRITE_TOOL}`.\n\
2. Reply with that relative path plus a short abstract, not the full payload.\n\
3. Quote the path exactly, so the parent can open it verbatim.\n\
\n\
Rules:\n\
- Offload paths are always relative to your action directory. Never write outside it, and never target the core's internal workspace state.\n\
- Keep the abstract honest: say what the file holds and what is still open. Never present it as the complete result.\n\
- Small results stay inline. A pointer to a two-line file costs the parent more than the two lines.\n\
- If you inline an oversized result anyway, the harness persists it under `{OUTPUTS_DIR}/` and hands the parent the path instead.\n"
