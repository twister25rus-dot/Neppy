//! Types for the interactive plan-review gate.
//!
//! A plan review parks a live (interactive) agent turn after the orchestrator
//! has laid out a thread-scoped plan, surfaces the plan to the user, and
//! resumes the SAME turn with the user's decision. Unlike the task-board
//! approval lifecycle (which the background dispatcher runs on the
//! `user-tasks` / `task-sources` boards), this gate is a parked-future on the
//! live turn — modelled on [`crate::openhuman::security::approval::ApprovalGate`] but
//! in-memory only: an interactive turn that can't resume across a restart has
//! nothing to persist.
