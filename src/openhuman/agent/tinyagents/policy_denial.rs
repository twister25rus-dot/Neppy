//! Structured, actionable messages for policy / permission denials.
//!
//! When the harness blocks a tool call at a policy or permission boundary, the
//! agent must not dead-end with a bare "blocked" line. Each denial is rendered
//! into a structured message — **what** was blocked, **why**, and a concrete
//! **workaround** (how to enable it, or a permitted alternative) — followed by
//! an explicit instruction to relay it to the user rather than halting
//! silently. The rendered string is returned as the (failed) tool result, so it
//! flows back into the turn the same way the unknown-tool corrective error is
//! surfaced to the model (see PR #4360).
//!
//! The relay instruction also states, at the point of denial, that the tool did
//! not run and that no result for it may be reported. Pressure to produce a
//! substantive answer, next to a tool result that carries no output, is an
//! invitation for a weak model to fill the gap: an observed turn had every
//! shell call denied and the agent then reported a fabricated directory listing
//! and `git log` as if they had run. The system prompt's grounding rule did not
//! bite; a contradiction sitting in the tool result itself has a better chance.
//! It is a mitigation, not a guarantee — detecting fabrication needs the
//! tool-call record carried out to the caller.
