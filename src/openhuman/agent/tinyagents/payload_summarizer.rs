//! Oversized-tool-result compression via the `summarizer` sub-agent.
//!
//! ## The problem
//!
//! When the orchestrator calls a tool that returns a huge payload — a
//! Composio action dumping 200 KB of JSON, a web scrape returning 50 KB
//! of markdown, a `file_read` spitting back a multi-thousand-line log —
//! the raw blob lands verbatim in the orchestrator's history and burns
//! context budget. The only existing guardrail is
//! [`crate::openhuman::config::ContextConfig::tool_result_budget_bytes`],
//! which hard-truncates mid-payload, dropping whatever happens to be
//! past the cut.
//!
//! ## The fix
//!
//! This module routes oversized tool results through a dedicated
//! `summarizer` sub-agent (model hint `"summarization"`) before they
//! enter agent history. The summarizer compresses the payload per an
//! extraction contract that preserves identifiers and key facts, and
//! the compressed summary is what the parent agent sees. Truncation
//! remains the final backstop downstream when summarization fails or
//! the payload is so absurdly large that paying for an LLM call on it
//! makes no economic sense.
//!
//! ## Trigger conditions
//!
//! [`PayloadSummarizer::maybe_summarize_in_parent`] leaves the raw payload in
//! place when:
//!
//! * The raw payload is below
//!   [`SubagentPayloadSummarizer::threshold_tokens`] (config default 4 000
//!   tokens — small payloads aren't worth an extra LLM round-trip).
//!   Token count is estimated as `chars / 4`, matching
//!   `tree_summarizer::estimate_tokens`.
//! * The raw payload is above
//!   [`SubagentPayloadSummarizer::max_payload_tokens`] (default
//!   2 000 000 tokens — too big to summarize cost-effectively; existing
//!   `tool_result_budget_bytes` truncation handles it instead).
//! * The internal failure circuit-breaker has tripped (3 consecutive
//!   sub-agent failures within the same session disable summarization
//!   for the rest of the session, so a broken summarizer can't tank
//!   every tool call).
//! * The sub-agent dispatch returns an error or an empty / non-shrinking
//!   summary — pass-through preserves the raw payload as a safety net.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! Only the orchestrator session gets a `PayloadSummarizer` wired in
//! ([`crate::openhuman::agent::harness::session::builder::AgentBuilder`]
//! checks `agent_id == "orchestrator"`). Welcome, integrations_agent,
//! researcher, planner, archivist, and every other typed sub-agent get
//! `None` and their tool results are untouched. The summarizer itself
//! is also `None` so it can never recursively summarize its own input.
