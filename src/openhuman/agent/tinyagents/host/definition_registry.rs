//! Host implementation of the TinyAgents **agent catalogue** seam.
//!
//! Adapts two OpenHuman domains onto
//! [`tinyagents::harness::host::DefinitionRegistry`]:
//!
//! * [`crate::openhuman::agent::harness::definition::AgentDefinitionRegistry`] —
//!   the harness registry of built-in ([`load_builtins`](crate::openhuman::agent::registry::agents::load_builtins)-parsed
//!   `agent.toml`)
//!   and workspace-override agent definitions, plus the config-backed
//!   user-authored fallback
//!   ([`crate::openhuman::agent::registry::find_custom_in_config`] →
//!   [`crate::openhuman::agent::registry::definition_from_registry_entry`]).
//! * [`crate::openhuman::agent::profiles::AgentProfile`] — the active personality,
//!   whose `allowed_tools` list is a **restriction** on the resolved
//!   definition's tool surface.
//!
//! This is `docs/specs/plan-agents.md` Phase 4. The crate-side
//! [`AgentDefinition`] is inert (`serde` + `std`); OpenHuman's harness
//! definition is far richer (prompt builders, sandbox mode, iteration policy,
//! TokenJuice profile, turn graph). Only the six fields the turn loop can act
//! on cross the seam; everything else stays host-side by design.
//!
//! # Contract mismatches resolved here
//!
//! **1. Absence must never be an error.** OpenHuman's own catalogue relies on
//! this: `orchestrator/agent.toml` lists `mcp_agent` in `subagents` even in a
//! build with the `mcp` feature off, and both existing resolution sites
//! tolerate it (`collect_orchestrator_tools` warns and skips;
//! [`validate_tier_hierarchy`](crate::openhuman::agent::registry::agents::validate_tier_hierarchy) explicitly `continue`s past unknown ids). So
//! `OpenHumanDefinitionRegistry::resolve` returns `Ok(None)` for every miss
//! and this adapter has no error path at all.
//!
//! **2. Declared vs authorized subagents.** The crate's
//! `AgentDefinition::subagents` is only what an agent *declares*;
//! `delegates_for` must return the **authorized** set. OpenHuman's authority is
//! the tier hierarchy, so `delegates_for` applies
//! [`validate_tier_transition`](crate::openhuman::agent::harness::definition::validate_tier_transition)
//! — the same single source of truth
//! [`validate_tier_hierarchy`](crate::openhuman::agent::registry::agents::validate_tier_hierarchy) walks at boot — per declared pair. A `Worker`
//! parent yields an empty list; a tier-illegal child is dropped. Unknown child
//! ids are **kept**, matching both [`validate_tier_hierarchy`](crate::openhuman::agent::registry::agents::validate_tier_hierarchy)'s `continue` and
//! the trait's note that an authorized id may still fail to resolve.
//!
//! **3. `ToolScope::Wildcard` has no crate representation.** The crate models
//! tools as an explicit `Vec<String>` in which **empty means unrestricted**,
//! matching the session builder ("an empty `visible` set means no filter" —
//! `agent/harness/session/builder/factory.rs`). So an unrestricted wildcard
//! agent maps to an empty `tools` vec.
//!
//! That one value must not be made to carry three meanings. Three distinct
//! situations would otherwise all collapse onto "empty", and each would read
//! back as *every tool*:
//!
//! * a named scope configured with **no** tools,
//! * a named scope whose every entry the denylist removed,
//! * a wildcard scope carrying a denylist the crate cannot express.
//!
//! [`ResolvedScope`] therefore models wildcard-ness explicitly and never infers
//! it from emptiness. A genuinely empty scope emits
//! [`PROFILE_NO_TOOLS_SENTINEL`] — an unregistered name that matches nothing —
//! and a wildcard-with-denylist is materialized against
//! [`Self::with_registered_tools`], failing closed when that is absent.
//!
//! **4. `SubagentEntry::Skills` entries are omitted.** A `{ skills = "*" }`
//! entry is not an agent id — it collapses into the single
//! `delegate_to_integrations_agent` tool. Emitting a synthetic id here would
//! invent a delegate the host never authorized.
//!
//! **5. Profile model overrides are deliberately not applied.**
//! `AgentProfile::model_override` has no verified host consumer on the
//! definition path (the web-chat `model_override` request parameter is a
//! different value, applied to `Config::default_model`), and the model seam is
//! `ModelResolver`'s, not the catalogue's. See the `TODO(phase4)` below.
