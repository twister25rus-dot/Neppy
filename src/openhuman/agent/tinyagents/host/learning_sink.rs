//! Host adapter for [`tinyagents::harness::host::LearningSink`] — the seam the
//! generic agent runtime uses to hand a finished turn to OpenHuman's
//! self-learning subsystem.
//!
//! This is `docs/specs/plan-agents.md` Phase 4. OpenHuman already has a
//! post-turn learning fan-out: [`crate::openhuman::agent::hooks::PostTurnHook`]
//! implementations (`UserProfileHook`, `ToolTrackerHook`, `ReflectionHook`,
//! `ToolMemoryCaptureHook`, `AgentExperienceCaptureHook`, `ArchivistHook`, …)
//! dispatched by [`crate::openhuman::agent::hooks::fire_hooks`]. That function
//! is already exactly the shape the crate's trait doc asks for — it
//! `tokio::spawn`s every hook and returns immediately, logging failures rather
//! than propagating them. So this adapter is deliberately thin: translate
//! [`TurnSummary`] into a [`TurnContext`] and enqueue.
//!
//! # Contract mismatches, and how each is resolved
//!
//! **1. `tools_invoked` is names-only; `TurnContext.tool_calls` is outcomes.**
//! This is the load-bearing mismatch. [`TurnSummary::tools_invoked`] carries a
//! deduplicated list of tool *names* by design — the crate doc is explicit that
//! arguments and results must never travel this path because the record is
//! built to be persisted. OpenHuman's
//! [`crate::openhuman::agent::hooks::ToolCallRecord`] is the opposite: it exists
//! to carry `success`, `duration_ms`, and a sanitized `output_summary`, and
//! every outcome-mining hook (`ToolTrackerHook`, `AgentExperienceCaptureHook`)
//! reads precisely those fields.
//!
//! There is no honest projection from one to the other. Synthesizing records
//! with `success: true, duration_ms: 0` would make `ToolTrackerHook` write
//! fabricated success rates and a corrupted running average into the
//! `tool_effectiveness` namespace, and would make
//! `AgentExperienceCaptureHook` mine "successful multi-tool experience"
//! candidates from a turn whose tools may all have failed. Persisting an
//! invented outcome is worse than persisting none, so **`tool_calls` is left
//! empty** and the names are emitted to the log only. The outcome-driven hooks
//! then self-disable (both early-return on an empty `tool_calls`), which is the
//! correct degradation: silent no-op, not silent lies.
//!
//! The hooks that read the *text* of the turn — `UserProfileHook`'s preference
//! extraction and `ReflectionHook`'s heuristic cue fast-path, which runs before
//! and independently of the `min_turn_complexity` gate — are unaffected and
//! keep working from a names-only summary.
//!
//! **2. `thread_id` vs `session_id`.** `TurnContext.session_id` is populated
//! host-side from the harness' `event_session_id`; a [`TurnSummary`] only
//! carries a [`tinyagents::harness::ids::ThreadId`]. The thread id is the
//! closest available correlation key, so it is mapped through. The visible
//! consequence is that `ReflectionHook`'s `max_reflections_per_session` throttle
//! becomes per-thread rather than per-session on this path — a slightly
//! different, but not incorrect, bucketing.
//!
//! **3. Missing fields.** [`TurnSummary`] has no wall-clock duration and no
//! model-call count, so `turn_duration_ms` is `0` and `iteration_count` is `1`.
//! Neither is read by any gate; they are reporting fields only. `entrypoint` is
//! `None` because the crate summary has no notion of a channel.
//!
//! **4. Errors are advisory.** The trait doc is emphatic that the turn is
//! already committed and an `Err` must not roll it back. `fire_hooks` is
//! infallible and non-blocking, so [`OpenHumanLearningSink::on_turn_complete`]
//! always returns `Ok(())`; hook failures surface in the host log where they
//! belong.
//!
//! # Domains deliberately not wired here
//!
//! - [`crate::openhuman::agent::learning::transcript_ingest`] is *transcript-file*
//!   driven (`ingest_transcript_path` / `ingest_session_transcript` take a
//!   session `.jsonl` on disk) and runs on session close, not per turn. A sink
//!   invocation has no transcript to point at.
//!
//! It is reachable through the same `Memory` those hooks write to, so nothing
//! is lost by leaving it on its own cadence.
