//! Host [`SecurityGate`] — OpenHuman's answer to "may this tool run?" and
//! "may this text enter the model context?".
//!
//! This is `docs/specs/plan-agents.md` Phase 4 for the most policy-sensitive
//! seam in the set. The tinyagents runtime holds *no* authority: it asks, and
//! obeys. Everything it would otherwise have to guess at lives on this side —
//! the autonomy tier, the command classifier, the per-channel tool policy, the
//! human-in-the-loop approval park, and the prompt-injection screen.
//!
//! # Domains adapted
//!
//! - [`crate::openhuman::security::policy`] — [`SecurityPolicy`], its
//!   [`SecurityPolicy::classify_command`] / [`SecurityPolicy::check_gated_command`]
//!   /  [`SecurityPolicy::gate_decision`] triad, and [`AutonomyLevel`].
//! - [`crate::openhuman::approval`] — the process-global [`ApprovalGate`],
//!   [`GateOutcome`], and the `summarize_action` / `redact_args` pair that keep
//!   raw arguments out of the approval card.
//! - [`crate::openhuman::agent_tool_policy`] — a pre-built [`ToolPolicySession`]
//!   (channel permission boundary).
//! - [`crate::openhuman::prompt_injection`] — [`enforce_prompt_input`] for
//!   [`SecurityGate::screen_input`].
//!
//! # Contract mismatches, resolved in favour of the existing guard
//!
//! 1. **"Answer, do not act" vs. the rate limiter.** OpenHuman's
//!    [`SecurityPolicy::enforce_tool_operation`] *records* an action against the
//!    sliding-window tracker as a side effect of authorizing one. The trait
//!    forbids acting, and the tools call it themselves anyway, so this adapter
//!    reads the non-mutating [`SecurityPolicy::is_rate_limited`] instead. A gate
//!    that called `enforce_tool_operation` would double-count every tool call
//!    and exhaust the hourly budget at twice the configured rate.
//! 2. **This gate owns approval, and must be the only thing that prompts.**
//!    `intercept_audited` hands back a `request_id` so the caller can log the
//!    *terminal* status once the tool resolves, but this trait returns before
//!    the tool runs and is never called again. The tempting shape — park here
//!    with the plain [`ApprovalGate::intercept`] and let
//!    `ApprovalSecurityMiddleware` record the terminal row — does not work: the
//!    middleware can only obtain an id by issuing its *own* `intercept_audited`,
//!    which raises a **second** approval card for a call the user already
//!    approved. A one-shot approval does not settle that second request, so the
//!    call would wait out a second TTL and then be denied.
//!
//!    So ownership is consolidated here. This adapter calls
//!    `intercept_audited`, stashes the id under the call id, and exposes
//!    [`OpenHumanSecurityGate::take_audit_request_id`] for the executor to drain
//!    and hand to [`ApprovalGate::record_execution`]. **A runner that installs
//!    this gate must not also compose `ApprovalSecurityMiddleware`'s approval
//!    step** — the two are alternatives, not layers. The session-allowlist
//!    shortcut yields no id and needs no terminal row.
//! 3. **No `Redacted` outcome is ever produced.** OpenHuman can *detect* PII
//!    ([`crate::openhuman::security::pii::scan`]) but exposes no verified
//!    public helper that rewrites free text into a redacted copy — the one that
//!    exists (`approval::redact::scrub_paths`) is private and shaped for JSON
//!    argument maps. Screening therefore only ever passes or blocks. See the
//!    `TODO(phase4)` in [`OpenHumanSecurityGate::screen_input`].
//! 4. **An absent approval gate allows, it does not deny.** When
//!    [`ApprovalGate::try_global`] is `None` (CLI, headless embed, tests) a
//!    `Prompt` decision cannot be resolved by a human. This adapter warns
//!    loudly and allows — byte-for-byte the behaviour of the
//!    `ApprovalSecurityMiddleware` it stands in for. Changing it to a denial
//!    here would be a *new* restriction invented by an adapter, not the
//!    honouring of an existing guard, and would break every non-desktop host.
//!    The deterministic `Block` path is unaffected: it never consults the gate.
//!
//!    **One exception, and it runs the other way.** A `RequireApproval` verdict
//!    from the *channel tool policy* denies when no gate is installed. That is
//!    not an invented restriction: `agent_tool_policy::engine` already files
//!    `RequireApproval` under `blocked_tool_names` alongside `Deny`, so the
//!    thing being honoured is a block, and the only thing that can lift it is a
//!    human actually approving. Allowing instead would turn the channel's
//!    strictest non-deny setting into its weakest on precisely the hosts with
//!    no human present. See [`ToolPolicyVerdict`].
//!
//! Nothing here widens a permission. Every branch that cannot establish
//! permission returns [`GateDecision::Deny`], including an unrecognised tool
//! name.
