//! Host capability: **which** model answers a turn.
//!
//! Adapts [`tinyagents::harness::host::ModelResolver`] onto OpenHuman's
//! inference domain — `crate::openhuman::inference::provider` (the per-role
//! provider factory: [`create_chat_model_with_model_id`], `provider_for_role`,
//! [`role_for_model_tier`]) driven by a [`Config`] snapshot.
//!
//! This is `docs/specs/plan-agents.md` Phase 4. The crate deliberately refuses
//! to know about tiers, lead/subagent economics, or BYOK-vs-managed routing —
//! all of that is OpenHuman product policy, and this module is where it lives.
//! The mapping performed here is exactly the one the rest of the core already
//! performs: *workload role* → provider string → concrete `ChatModel`. Nothing
//! about provider selection, BYOK inheritance, or egress disclosure is
//! re-implemented; it is all reached through `create_chat_model_with_model_id`,
//! which is the single chokepoint that emits the `ExternalTransfer` egress
//! disclosure. Building a client by any other route would bypass that guard.
//!
//! # Contract mismatches resolved here
//!
//! 1. **`State` erasure.** The trait is generic over the harness state
//!    (`ModelResolver<State>` must return `Arc<dyn ChatModel<State>>`), but
//!    every model OpenHuman builds is a `ChatModel<()>` — the core's harness
//!    carries its per-turn context in task-locals and `RunContext`, not in a
//!    typed state value. [`StatelessModel`] bridges the two: it implements
//!    `ChatModel<State>` for *any* `State` by discarding the state reference and
//!    invoking the inner model with `&()`. That is lossless today precisely
//!    because no OpenHuman model reads state; if one ever does, it must stop
//!    going through this wrapper rather than silently observing `()`.
//!
//! 2. **"resolve is cheap, and must not be memoized by the caller."** The trait
//!    tells the *runtime* not to cache, which leaves the host free to. A fresh
//!    `create_chat_model_with_model_id` per turn would hand back a new provider
//!    client and throw away its connection pool — the exact waste the trait's
//!    `Arc` return is trying to avoid. Since this resolver holds an immutable
//!    `Arc<Config>` snapshot, the answer for a given workload role cannot change
//!    over its lifetime, so [`OpenHumanModelResolver`] memoizes per role. A
//!    caller that needs re-resolution after a config edit constructs a new
//!    resolver, which is how every other `Arc<Config>` holder in the core works.
//!
//! 3. **Tiered routing is not represented.** OpenHuman's richer per-turn model
//!    bundle (primary + workload-tier fallback routes + summarizer) is
//!    `TurnModelSource` / `TurnModels` in `super::super` — a *bundle*, not one
//!    `Arc<dyn ChatModel>`, so it does not fit this signature. See the
//!    `TODO(phase4)` on [`OpenHumanModelResolver::base_model_for_role`].
//!
//! 4. **`ModelResolveRequest::model_pin` is not honoured yet.** The field
//!    exists now (`tinyagents#89`, which this resolver's `-v1` suffix test was
//!    written against while the pin had nowhere to go), so a definition's exact
//!    model id finally has a route here rather than being smuggled through
//!    `role`. It is deliberately still unread, for two reasons:
//!
//!    * **Nothing constructs a `ModelResolveRequest` yet.** The crate does not
//!      emit one and this resolver is not repointed, so honouring the pin today
//!      would be code with no producer and no test that could fail honestly.
//!    * **There is no build-by-exact-id seam to honour it with.**
//!      `create_chat_model_with_model_id` takes a *role*, not a model id, so
//!      honouring a pin means adding that path in
//!      `inference::provider::factory` and deciding what happens when the
//!      pinned id is not configured — a real design question, not plumbing.
//!
//!    When it is wired: the pin is **advisory**. The host decides whether it
//!    can be honoured, because the runtime has no view of credentials or
//!    provider health. Validate the id against configured providers and fall
//!    back to role routing with a warning; never pass it through blind.
