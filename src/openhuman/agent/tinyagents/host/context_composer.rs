//! Host adapter: [`tinyagents::harness::host::ContextComposer`] backed by
//! OpenHuman's prompt pipeline.
//!
//! # Which OpenHuman domains this adapts
//!
//! * [`crate::openhuman::agent::prompts`] (re-exported as
//!   `crate::openhuman::agent::context::prompt`) — `SystemPromptBuilder`,
//!   `PromptContext`, `LearnedContextData`, `ConnectedIntegration`,
//!   `ToolCallFormat`, `load_agents_md_layers`, `render_connected_identities`.
//!   The `SOUL.md` / `IDENTITY.md` / `HEARTBEAT.md` bootstrap files under
//!   `src/openhuman/agent/prompts/` are loaded (and synced to the workspace)
//!   by `IdentitySection` inside `SystemPromptBuilder::build`, so this adapter
//!   never reads them itself.
//! * [`crate::openhuman::config::Config`] — supplies `workspace_dir`,
//!   `action_dir`, the default model, and the `agents_md_enabled` gate.
//! * [`crate::openhuman::desktop::app_state::peek_cached_current_user_identity`] — the
//!   non-secret `id`/`name`/`email` triple. Deliberately read through the
//!   *cache peek*, which is the accessor that strips credential material; this
//!   adapter must not reach for a richer user record to fill the prompt.
//!
//! Prompt assembly is **not** reimplemented here. Everything this file does is
//! translate a [`TurnContextRequest`] into a `PromptContext` and hand it to the
//! existing `SystemPromptBuilder::with_defaults()` chain — the same chain
//! `agent::harness::session::turn::context::build_system_prompt` uses. That
//! keeps one source of truth for section ordering, the grounding contract, and
//! the global style suffix.
//!
//! # Contract mismatches resolved here
//!
//! 1. **Per-turn call vs. frozen prefix.** The crate consults a composer on
//!    *every* turn (`context_composer.rs`: "a host whose learned context …
//!    changes mid-session needs the later turns to see it"). OpenHuman's
//!    pipeline goes the other way: `SystemPromptBuilder::build`'s rustdoc
//!    states the rendered bytes are "intended to be **frozen for the whole
//!    session**" so the inference backend's prefix cache hits. Both are
//!    honoured by construction — every input this adapter feeds the builder is
//!    a snapshot captured at *construction* time (config, learned context,
//!    connected integrations), so recomposing per turn yields byte-identical
//!    output unless the host deliberately builds a new composer. The two
//!    genuinely time-varying sections in the default chain
//!    (`DateTimeSection`, and the on-disk files `IdentitySection` reads) are
//!    OpenHuman's pre-existing behaviour on the main-agent path, not something
//!    this seam introduces.
//! 2. **`thread_id` and `user_text` are unused inputs.** `PromptContext` has no
//!    thread field and no turn-text field: OpenHuman scopes learned context
//!    *outside* the prompt layer and pre-fetches it (see every existing
//!    `PromptContext { learned: … }` call site). Rather than invent a
//!    thread-keyed fetch, this adapter takes a caller-supplied
//!    [`LearnedContextData`] snapshot — exactly the established pattern — and
//!    logs the thread id for correlation. See the TODO on
//!    [`OpenHumanContextComposer::learned`].
//! 3. **`preamble` returns an empty `Vec`, always.** OpenHuman has no separate
//!    preamble concept: goals, pinned context, and memory blocks are all
//!    rendered *into* the system prompt as `PromptSection`s. Per the trait's
//!    "Empty is not failure" note this is the normal, correct answer, not a
//!    gap — synthesising extra messages here would duplicate content the
//!    system prompt already carries.
//!
//! # Policy
//!
//! The `agents_md_enabled` config gate is honoured: when it is off, both
//! AGENTS.md layers are handed to the builder as `None` rather than being
//! loaded. `load_agents_md_layers` performs the `O_NOFOLLOW` path hardening
//! that keeps a symlinked project-layer `AGENTS.md` from leaking arbitrary
//! host files into the prompt (and thence to the inference provider); this
//! adapter goes through it rather than reading the files itself.
