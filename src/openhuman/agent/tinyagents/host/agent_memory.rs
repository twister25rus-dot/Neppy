//! Host capability adapter: [`AgentMemory`] over OpenHuman's memory stack.
//!
//! This is `docs/specs/plan-agents.md` Phase 4 for the memory seam. The agent
//! runtime is being made generic over its host, so it must stop reaching into
//! [`crate::openhuman::memory`] directly. Instead the crate declares
//! [`AgentMemory`] and this module is the single place OpenHuman's memory
//! domains meet it.
//!
//! # Domains adapted
//!
//! - [`crate::openhuman::memory`] — the `Memory` trait, `MemoryEntry`,
//!   `MemoryCategory`, `MemoryTaint`, `RecallOpts`.
//! - `crate::openhuman::agent::tinyagents::retriever::recall_through_facade` — the
//!   existing retrieval facade (issue #4249, 09.2). Recall goes **through** it
//!   rather than calling `Memory::recall` directly, so this adapter inherits
//!   OpenHuman's ranking engine verbatim, the `path_scope` dedupe rule, and the
//!   `AgentEvent::MemoryLoaded` emission instead of forking a second recall path.
//! - [`crate::openhuman::memory::safety`] — `sanitize_text`, the
//!   conservative secret + PII scrubber, applied on the way out of recall and on
//!   the way in to `remember`.
//! - [`crate::openhuman::memory::agent::memory_loader::MemoryCitation`] — the
//!   host's citation shape, rendered down to the opaque string the crate wants.
//!
//! # Where the policy lives, and why it lives *here*
//!
//! The trait's contract is explicit: items returned by [`AgentMemory::recall`]
//! have **already** been scope-filtered and redacted, and the runtime is
//! forbidden from re-ranking or re-filtering them. That makes this adapter the
//! last place OpenHuman's guards can run, so all of them run here:
//!
//! - **Scope is host-chosen, never runtime-chosen.** `RecallRequest`'s
//!   `agent_id` / `thread_id` / `limit` are documented as *hints about the
//!   caller*, not instructions about storage. The namespace comes from this
//!   adapter's own configuration and is never derived from a runtime field —
//!   the same "the tool has no namespace parameter" discipline
//!   `crate::openhuman::flows::memory_tools` uses to keep a flow inside its
//!   own sandbox. A thread hint may only *narrow* the query (it becomes
//!   `RecallOpts::session_id`), never widen it, and `cross_session` stays a
//!   wiring-time decision that defaults to `false`.
//! - **A defensive second scope pass.** Even with `session_id` set, recalled
//!   rows are re-checked host-side and any row carrying a *different* session is
//!   dropped. Unscoped rows (`session_id: None`) stay visible, matching the
//!   crate's own `InMemoryAgentMemory` scoping semantics. The pass is skipped
//!   when `cross_session` is on: that flag was already sent to the backend as an
//!   instruction to return other sessions' rows, so a same-session re-test would
//!   throw away everything the widening returned and reduce the opt-in to a
//!   no-op. The guard exists to catch a backend that ignored a *narrowing*
//!   request, and widening is the opposite of that.
//! - **Redaction is unconditional.** Every returned `text` and every citation
//!   snippet goes through `sanitize_text`, so no raw store row reaches the
//!   runtime. A row that the scrubber changed is logged (counts only, never
//!   content).
//! - **Provenance is stamped host-side.** `NewMemory` deliberately carries no
//!   taint field, so this adapter supplies one and writes through
//!   `Memory::store_with_taint`. It **fails closed to
//!   [`MemoryTaint::ExternalSync`]**: an agent turn may have been summarizing an
//!   email or a web page, this adapter cannot tell, and `ExternalSync` is the
//!   value OpenHuman's subconscious gate treats as "unknown origin, refuse
//!   external-effect tools". [`OpenHumanAgentMemory::with_taint`] lets a wiring
//!   site that genuinely knows better relax it.
//!
//! # Contract mismatches resolved
//!
//! 1. **`remember` returns an id, `Memory::store` does not.** OpenHuman's write
//!    path is an upsert keyed by `(namespace, key)` and hands nothing back. To
//!    keep the id space coherent with the ids `recall` returns, this adapter
//!    reads the row back with `Memory::get` after storing and returns the
//!    backend's own `MemoryEntry::id`, falling back to the synthetic
//!    `"{namespace}/{key}"` handle when the read-back finds nothing.
//! 2. **`MemoryItem::citation` is an opaque `String`.** The host's
//!    `MemoryCitation` is a structured UI contract; leaking its JSON would
//!    couple the crate to OpenHuman's frontend. It is built for real (so the
//!    seam uses the host type rather than a parallel one) and then rendered to a
//!    single flat `openhuman:memory/...` line by [`render_citation`].
//! 3. **`thread_summary` returns `Ok(None)`.** See the method docs — OpenHuman
//!    has no host-authored per-thread prose rollup to return, and the trait
//!    forbids synthesizing a substitute.
//! 4. **`NewMemory::tags` are dropped.** The trait calls them advisory and
//!    explicitly permits a host to discard them; OpenHuman's `Memory::store` has
//!    no tag column, and folding runtime-supplied labels into the namespace or
//!    key would turn an advisory hint into a scope, which the trait forbids.
//!    They are logged and otherwise ignored.
