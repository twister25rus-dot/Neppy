//! System prompt builder for the `orchestrator` built-in agent.
//!
//! The orchestrator follows a direct-first policy: respond directly or use
//! cheap direct tools whenever possible, and delegate only for specialised
//! execution. It never executes Composio actions itself; the integration
//! block points to the single collapsed `delegate_to_integrations_agent`
//! tool (synthesised by `orchestrator_tools::collect_orchestrator_tools`,
//! #1335) for true external-service operations, with the toolkit slug
//! passed as an argument. That prose lives here (not in the shared
//! prompts module) so the skill-executor voice stays in
//! `integrations_agent/prompt.rs` and nobody has to branch on `agent_id`
//! in a shared section impl.

         real per-toolkit catalogue is wider than the common-knowledge summary \
         (e.g. Gmail exposes bulk delete, batch modify, thread trash, etc.) and \
         the user may have enabled scopes that expose further destructive actions. \
         Therefore:\n\n\
         - If the user asks **\"can you do X with {{toolkit}}?\"** or \"does \
         {{toolkit}} support Y?\" for a connected toolkit above, **DO NOT** answer \
         from priors. **DELEGATE** to `integrations_agent` first and let it \
         inspect its live tool list (including `gated_tools` behind permission \
         toggles) before answering.\n\
         - If the user requests an **action** on a connected toolkit (delete, \
         move, send, modify, label, etc.), **DELEGATE immediately**. Do not \
         pre-emptively refuse with \"I can't do that\" — that's a confabulation \
         unless `integrations_agent` itself has already reported the action as \
         unavailable.\n\
         - The only honest \"no\" comes back from a delegation that found the \
         action neither in the visible `tools` list nor in the `gated_tools` \
         (permission-toggle) list of the sub-agent.\n\
         - **Cross-chat context is historical, not authoritative.** If the \
         `{cross_chat_header_for_prompt}` block contains a past \"I can / can't \
         do X with {{toolkit}}\" statement, treat it as a snapshot from an \
         earlier moment. The tool list, connected integrations, and per-toolkit \
         scope toggles (read / write / admin) can all change between chats — a \
         past refusal may be stale. Verify against the **current** `## Connected \
         Integrations` block above and (when in doubt) **DELEGATE** before \
         quoting any past capability claim. Never echo a stale \"I can't\" \
         without re-checking.\n\n",
