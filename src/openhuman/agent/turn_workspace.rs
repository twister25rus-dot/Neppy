//! Agent turn workspace — the per-turn filesystem root an embedder binds a
//! single agent turn to.
//!
//! A host that drives the core in-process (the Medulla TUI's embedded core, a
//! workflow node dispatched to the `openhuman` harness) runs one turn *against
//! a checkout it names*, not against the operator's ambient
//! [`Config::action_dir`](crate::openhuman::config::Config). Everything the
//! core already had for this was **process-global**: `action_dir` comes from
//! config, and [`SecurityPolicy`](crate::openhuman::security::SecurityPolicy)
//! is installed once per process, so two concurrent turns could not disagree
//! about where they are allowed to write.
//!
//! This module is the per-turn answer, deliberately shaped like
//! [`super::turn_origin`]: a [`tokio::task_local`] the entry point scopes
//! around its `run_turn` invocation, read by the two places that decide where
//! a turn may work:
//!
//! * the session builder
//!   ([`Agent::from_config`](crate::openhuman::agent::Agent::from_config)),
//!   which turns it into the turn's
//!   [`WorkspaceDescriptor`](tinyagents::harness::workspace::WorkspaceDescriptor)
//!   so acting tools (shell, file, git) resolve their default cwd there; and
//! * [`SecurityPolicy::is_within_trusted_root`](crate::openhuman::security::SecurityPolicy::is_within_trusted_root),
//!   which treats the scoped root as a read/write trusted root for the
//!   duration of the turn, so a write into that checkout is not refused as an
//!   escape from `workspace_dir`.
//!
//! # Trust
//!
//! Scoping a root here is a **grant**, exactly as strong as a user-configured
//! [`TrustedRoot`](crate::openhuman::security::TrustedRoot) with
//! `access = ReadWrite`, and it is scoped to one turn rather than persisted.
//! It therefore never weakens the two invariants a trusted root has never been
//! able to weaken: credential stores
//! ([`SecurityPolicy::is_always_forbidden`](crate::openhuman::security::SecurityPolicy::is_always_forbidden))
//! and workspace-internal application state stay unreachable. An embedder
//! scopes it only for a root it already decided the turn owns — a workflow
//! run's checkout — which is why the API takes an owned [`PathBuf`] the caller
//! resolved rather than a string the model could have supplied.
//!
//! Nothing is scoped by default: `current()` returning `None` is every
//! existing caller, and leaves path policy byte-identical.
