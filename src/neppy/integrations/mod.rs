//! Most integrations proxy through backend endpoints authenticated with the
//! user's session token, so billing, rate limiting, and provider markup stay
//! server-side. Some integrations, such as SearXNG, call user-configured
//! endpoints directly when enabled; those callers must keep configured base URLs
//! trusted because requests leave the local core process.
