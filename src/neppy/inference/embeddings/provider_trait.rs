//! Interface for embedding providers that convert text into numerical vectors.
//!
//! [`EmbeddingProvider`] and [`format_embedding_signature`] are **defined in
//! `tinymemory_api::host`** and re-exported here. The extracted memory subsystem
//! takes an `Arc<dyn EmbeddingProvider>` from this host, so the trait has to live
//! somewhere both sides can name — and it has to be *one* trait, not two
//! structurally identical ones, or the trait objects would not be
//! interchangeable.
//!
//! Every existing `inference::embeddings::EmbeddingProvider` path in this crate
//! keeps resolving, and keeps naming the same type.
//!
//! # [`TinyAgentsEmbeddingProvider`] is the host's, not the engine's (#5560)
//!
//! This adapter used to be `pub use tinymemory_core::embedding_adapter::…`, on
//! the reasoning that it could not live in the contract crate (which must not
//! depend on `tinyagents`) and could not live here either, because the memory
//! tree's embedder factory — engine code — also needed to wrap a `tinyagents`
//! model. `tinymemory-core` was the one crate that could name both sides.
//!
//! Only the first half of that was ever a constraint on *this* crate. The host
//! already depends on `tinyagents` directly — every construction site
//! (`factory.rs`, `cloud_adapter.rs`) builds a `tinyagents` `EmbeddingModel` and
//! wraps it here — so the adapter is 40 lines of glue between two dependencies
//! this crate already has, and reaching it through the engine crate was the only
//! thing keeping `tinymemory-core` linked for it.
//!
//! The engine keeps its own copy for its own factory. That is not duplication of
//! *state*: the adapter is a stateless newtype over a boxed trait object, both
//! sides wrap the same `tinyagents::harness::embeddings::EmbeddingModel` (one
//! crate — the root `[patch.crates-io]` points every consumer at
//! `vendor/tinyagents`), and both produce the same
//! `tinymemory_api::host::EmbeddingProvider`. Nothing reads the other's output,
//! which is the same shape the scrubbers, `util::redact` and
//! `memory::obsidian_registry` took when they came home.
//!
//! The signature is load-bearing and is **not** re-derived here:
//! [`format_embedding_signature`] stays the contract's, so a vector written
//! before this move and one written after land in the same embedding space.
