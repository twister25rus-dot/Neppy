//! Required structured-output validation & repair (issue #4117).
//!
//! Some agent contracts mandate a JSON block — e.g. a `thoughts` block like
//! `{"thoughts": "…", "next_action": "…"}` — on **every** turn, because
//! downstream parsing/routing depends on it. Models frequently omit the block
//! entirely, leaving those consumers with nothing.
//!
//! This module supplies the pure primitives the turn engine uses to guarantee a
//! well-formed block on every accepted turn:
//!
//! * [`output_satisfies_contract`] — validate presence + shape of the block,
//! * [`repair_instruction`] — the corrective re-prompt that asks the model to
//!   re-emit its reply with the block, and
//! * [`synthesize_block`] — a minimal, schema-valid block used as a deterministic
//!   fallback when the re-prompt also omits it.
//!
//! The orchestration that ties these together (validate → re-prompt → synthesize)
//! lives on the session in `session::turn::session_io` so it can drive the extra
//! provider call and reconcile with streaming; keeping the logic here pure keeps
//! it unit-testable without a provider.
