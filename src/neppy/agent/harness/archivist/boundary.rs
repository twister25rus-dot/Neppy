//! When one conversation segment ends and the next begins — and what to call it
//! when no model is available to say.
//!
//! # Why this is host-side
//!
//! These functions came from the engine's `segments` module, and unlike their
//! neighbours there they never touched the database: every one of them is a
//! pure function over values the caller already holds. That is what makes the
//! split obvious. Persisting a segment is storage; deciding *that a segment
//! should end* is a product judgement about what a conversation is — how long a
//! pause has to be before the subject has moved on, how many turns is too many,
//! which phrases signal a change of topic. A second engine has no business
//! holding an opinion on any of it, and the host that renders these segments to
//! the user is the only thing that can tune them against what users actually
//! see.
//!
//! The rest of the archivist's engine calls became the `Episodic` contract
//! family, which persists what this module decides.
//!
//! # The thresholds are unchanged, deliberately
//!
//! Every value here — the ten-minute gap, the 0.4 similarity floor, the
//! twenty-turn cap, the marker list, the 200-character bookends — is carried
//! over verbatim from the engine. This is a move, not a retune: changing
//! behaviour in the same step that changes where the behaviour lives would make
//! any resulting regression impossible to attribute. Tune them afterwards,
//! against real segments.
