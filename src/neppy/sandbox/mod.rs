//! Sandbox execution backends for agent tool isolation.
//!
//! Separates three concerns:
//! - **Where** tools run (this module — sandbox backend selection)
//! - **Which** tools are allowed (security policy / tool policy)
//! - **Whether** a tool needs host access (elevated ops)
//!
//! The gateway/core always runs on the host. Selected tool families
//! (shell, filesystem, process) execute inside a sandbox with controlled
//! workspace mounts, network policy, environment passthrough, and
//! explicit elevated escape paths.

// The CWD jail is the path-confinement half of the sandbox family: an in-Rust
// path guard that applies regardless of which sandbox backend is selected.
