//! Workspace-path adapter onto tinyagents' authoritative goal store.
//!
//! **Crate-backed.** The per-thread goal now lives in the vendored `tinyagents`
//! crate's `graph::goals` KV store
//! (`<workspace>/tinyagents_store/kv/graph.goals/<hex(thread_id)>.json`), not
//! the legacy `<workspace>/thread_goals/` file-JSON tree. This module is a thin
//! adapter: it preserves the historical `store::*(workspace_dir, …)` call
//! surface every consumer (RPC ops, the harness turn loop, the heartbeat
//! continuation runtime, the agent tools, and post-turn accounting) already
//! uses, and forwards each operation to the crate store — converting the crate
//! [`CrateThreadGoal`](tinyagents::graph::goals::types::ThreadGoal) back to the
//! local [`ThreadGoal`] and its `TinyAgentsError` to a `String`.
//!
//! The crate store owns the concurrency (per-thread async locks) and the goal
//! business logic (objective-change reset, budget re-open, status transitions,
//! suppression compare-and-set, and stale-goal-id accounting guards).
