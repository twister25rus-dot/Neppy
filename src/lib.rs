//! Core library for the OpenHuman platform.
//!
//! This crate provides the central logic for the OpenHuman core binary, including:
//! - API and RPC handlers for external interactions.
//! - Core system services (CLI, configuration, monitoring).
//! - Domain-specific logic for the OpenHuman agent runtime.

// The RPC dispatch chokepoint wraps each handler future in an ambient
// `CoreContext` scope (Phase 2). Combined with the already very deep async type
// stacks in the axum routes that fan out into the tinyagents harness, the extra
// future layer pushes the compiler's `Send` auto-trait solver past the default
// depth of 128 (E0275). Raising the limit is the standard remedy for deep async
// type recursion and costs nothing at runtime.
#![recursion_limit = "256"]
