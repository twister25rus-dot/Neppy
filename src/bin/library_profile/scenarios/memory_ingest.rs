//! `memory-ingest`: canonicalise and ingest 100 chat messages, then drain the
//! real extraction/admission/tree queue.
//!
//! # Why this still names the engine crate (#5560)
//!
//! It is measuring the in-process engine on purpose, and routing it through
//! `memory::binding` would not be a migration — it would be a different
//! measurement. `MemoryIngest::ingest_chat` on the contract hands items to
//! whatever driver the workspace bound, which in this binary is the **null**
//! driver (no module is loaded), so the number would be the cost of doing
//! nothing. And `queue::drain_until_idle` has no contract member at all: the
//! queue is not a capability family, and the point of this scenario is that the
//! extraction/admission/tree jobs actually run before the timer stops.
//!
//! So the honest fix here is a **feature gate, not a migration** — this binary
//! carries `required-features = ["rss-bench"]` and is local/dev only, and
//! `rss-bench` is deliberately absent from `scripts/ci/product-features.txt`,
//! so nothing here is in the shipped product graph. What it needs from the
//! manifest is for `tinymemory-core` to become `optional = true` with
//! `rss-bench` enabling it; a bin target cannot use dev-dependencies, so
//! demoting the crate to dev-only without that would break this build with the
//! gate on, in a configuration no CI lane compiles.
