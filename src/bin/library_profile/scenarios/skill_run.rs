//! `skill-run`: the true, process-*tree* cost of a skill step that executes on
//! a real language runtime — the interpreter child process included — and the
//! regression instrument for the shared runtime pool (issue #5106).
//!
//! ## What it actually runs
//!
//! A skill run's orchestrator (`spawn_workflow_run_background` → the
//! `orchestrator` agent) deliberately owns **no** `node_exec` tool: the
//! chat-tier orchestrator never executes code itself, it delegates every code
//! step to the `code_executor` specialist (the only builtin whose allow-list
//! carries `node_exec` / `npm_exec`). So the agent that genuinely spawns the
//! language runtime *is* `code_executor`. This scenario drives that specialist
//! directly — one turn, one scripted `node_exec` call — which is the real
//! node-executing path, not a bare `std::process` spawn.
//!
//! ## Concurrency knob (K parallel skill runs)
//!
//! `OPENHUMAN_PROFILE_SKILL_RUN_CONCURRENCY=K` (default 1) drives **K**
//! `code_executor` turns in parallel, each emitting its own `node_exec` call.
//! The point of #5106: with the runtime pool **on**, K concurrent skill runs
//! share a small bounded set of warm `node` workers, so the process tree grows
//! by ~one pooled worker — **not** K interpreters. This scenario asserts that
//! (`tree.child_count <= max_workers`) whenever pooling is on and K > 1, so a
//! regression that reintroduces per-run forking fails the profiling suite.
//!
//! Toggle for an A/B baseline:
//!
//! * `OPENHUMAN_PROFILE_SKILL_RUN_POOL=off` — disable the pool (legacy per-call
//!   spawn); the tree then shows ~K resident `node` children at peak.
//! * `OPENHUMAN_PROFILE_SKILL_RUN_POOL_WORKERS=W` — pool size (default 1, for a
//!   tight, deterministic bound).
//!
//! ## No interpreter download
//!
//! `node.prefer_system = true` (the default) means a host `node` whose **major**
//! matches the configured target is reused rather than downloaded. This
//! scenario **requires** a system `node` and bails with a clear stderr error +
//! nonzero exit if none is on `PATH` — it must never pull a runtime.
//!
//! The measured cost lands in `result.tree` (`tree_rss_kib`, `child_count`,
//! per-child RSS), captured at the workload peak.
