//! Run one OpenHuman agent turn as a library call.
//!
//! The counterpart to `embed_headless.rs`: that one shows how to *build* a core
//! and dispatch plumbing methods, this one shows the thing an embedder actually
//! wants — a prompt in, a reply out, with the model, the workspace and the
//! access tier chosen in code rather than discovered from the environment.
//!
//! ```bash
//! # Against any OpenAI-compatible endpoint:
//! OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1 \
//! OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_API_KEY=sk-… \
//! OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_MODEL=gpt-5 \
//!   cargo run --example run_turn -- "What can you see in this directory?"
//!
//! # Or against the machine's own configured inference, in its real workspace:
//! OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_INHERIT=1 cargo run --example run_turn -- "Hello."
//! ```
//!
//! Optional: `OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_BACKEND_URL` points the core's non-inference
//! backend calls somewhere, and `OPENHUMAN_EXAMPLE_SKILLS_DIR` supplies skill
//! bundles.
//!
//! Note the runtime is built by hand rather than with `#[tokio::main]`. That is
//! not incidental — see [`main`].
