//! Deterministic key derivation from a BIP-39 mnemonic.
//!
//! [`derive()`] turns a mnemonic and a derivation path into the signing key and
//! address for one chain. It is a pure function: same inputs, same key, every
//! time, with no I/O and no global state.
//!
//! ## This crate derives keys; it does not keep them
//!
//! Nothing here reads or writes a keychain, a file, or an environment
//! variable, and no key is cached between calls. Custody is deliberately the
//! host's problem: where the mnemonic is sealed, what unlocks it, whether the
//! user is prompted, and how long a decrypted phrase may live in memory are
//! all policy decisions that depend on the host's threat model, and a library
//! that quietly picked an answer would be picking it for every host.
//!
//! The consequence for a caller is that the mnemonic arrives as a `&str` the
//! host already decrypted, and this crate's job is to touch it briefly and
//! forget it.
//!
//! ## Two derivation algorithms, not one
//!
//! | Chain | Curve | Scheme |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | Bitcoin | secp256k1 | BIP-32 |
//! | EVM | secp256k1 | BIP-32 |
//! | Tron | secp256k1 | BIP-32 |
//! | Solana | ed25519 | SLIP-0010, hardened-only |
//!
//! The split is forced by the curve. BIP-32's non-hardened derivation needs
//! public-key addition, which ed25519 does not offer, so SLIP-0010 defines
//! hardened-only derivation for it. That is why [`Error::UnhardenedSolanaPath`]
//! exists: a path like `m/44'/501'/0'/0` is not merely unsupported here, it is
//! underivable, and accepting it by silently hardening the last segment would
//! hand back a *different account* than the path names.
