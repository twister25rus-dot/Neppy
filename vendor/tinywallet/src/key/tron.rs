//! Tron key derivation: BIP-32 on secp256k1, address via Keccak-256 plus the
//! `0x41` version byte and a base58check envelope.
//!
//! Identical to EVM up to the Keccak hash — Tron reuses Ethereum's address
//! construction and then re-encodes it. That similarity is a trap worth naming:
//! the hex form of a Tron address looks like an EVM address but is 21 bytes,
//! not 20, because of the version prefix.
