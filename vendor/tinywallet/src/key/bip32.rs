//! BIP-32 derivation on secp256k1, shared by Bitcoin, EVM and Tron.
//!
//! All three chains use the same scheme and differ only in what they do with
//! the resulting key, so the walk lives here once rather than three times.
//!
//! # This is delegated on purpose
//!
//! Rolling BIP-32 by hand is possible — it is HMAC-SHA512 plus a scalar
//! addition — but an off-by-one in the hardened-index encoding produces a
//! *valid key for the wrong account*, which is silent, unrecoverable, and
//! exactly the kind of bug not worth risking to avoid a dependency.
//!
//! That reasoning is unchanged from when this used `bitcoin`'s `Xpriv`. What
//! changed is which vetted implementation it delegates to: `coins-bip32`, whose
//! secp256k1 backend is the pure-Rust `k256` rather than the `secp256k1` C
//! library. The derived key is identical either way — BIP-32 is a specification,
//! not an implementation detail, and [`super::test`] pins the addresses against
//! the same fixed mnemonic as before the swap. `coins-bip32` is also the code
//! path `coins-bip39` already uses beneath [`super::seed_from_mnemonic`], so
//! this removes a native C build and a second elliptic-curve stack without
//! adding anything to the graph.
//!
//! Contrast [`crate::address::btc`], which *is* hand-rolled. The difference is
//! the failure mode, not the difficulty: a wrong parser is caught by the first
//! test vector, a wrong derivation is caught by nobody.
