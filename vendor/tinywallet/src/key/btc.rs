//! Bitcoin key derivation: BIP-32 on secp256k1, P2WPKH address.
//!
//! Produces a native segwit (`bc1q…`) address, matching
//! [`crate::address::btc::validate_sender`] — the only script type this crate's
//! callers can sign for. Deriving a P2PKH or P2SH address here would hand back
//! something that passes recipient validation and then fails at signing time.
//!
//! The address is assembled here rather than by the `bitcoin` crate, which this
//! module used to route through. A P2WPKH address is fully specified by BIP-141
//! and BIP-173 as `bech32(hrp="bc", version=0, hash160(compressed_pubkey))`, and
//! both halves of that are owned elsewhere: the bech32 encoding by
//! [`crate::address::btc::encode_p2wpkh`], which also decodes it, and the
//! BIP-32 walk by [`super::bip32`], which still delegates to a vetted
//! implementation.
