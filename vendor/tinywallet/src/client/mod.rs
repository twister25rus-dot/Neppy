//! Chain queries over the [`Transport`] seam.
//!
//! The first operations that need a network: reading a native balance, and
//! (for Bitcoin) listing the UTXOs a transfer would spend. Each is a thin,
//! chain-specific translation — build the right request, read the right field
//! out of the answer — with the actual I/O delegated to the host's
//! [`Transport`].
//!
//! ## Balances are returned in base units, never as a decimal
//!
//! [`balance`] returns a `u128` of the chain's smallest unit: satoshis, wei,
//! lamports, sun. It does **not** return a float or a formatted string, and
//! that is deliberate. `f64` cannot represent 1 wei exactly, so any float in a
//! balance path silently loses precision on ordinary mainnet values, and
//! formatting is a presentation concern that needs
//! [`Asset::decimals`](crate::asset::Asset::decimals) anyway — which the caller
//! has and this function should not assume.
//!
//! ## The address is validated before the request goes out
//!
//! Every operation validates its address first. A malformed address sent to a
//! node is answered inconsistently across chains — some 400, some return zero,
//! some return an error the caller may read as "empty wallet" — and "you typed
//! a bad address" is a much better answer than "your balance is 0".
