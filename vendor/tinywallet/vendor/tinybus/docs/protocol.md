# The tinybus wire protocol

Version 1. This document is the specification a non-Rust service is written
against; the Rust types in `crates/tinybus/src/message/` are one implementation
of it.

## Framing

Every message is a 4-byte big-endian unsigned length followed by that many bytes
of UTF-8 JSON.

```
+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------------------------+
|            length (u32, BE)       |  JSON payload (length B)  |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+---------------------------+
```

A reader **must** reject an announced length above 16 777 216 (16 MiB) without
allocating for it, and close the connection. The length arrives before the
bytes, so trusting it is a remote-triggered allocation.

Newline framing is deliberately not used: bodies legitimately contain newlines,
and a frame boundary must not depend on payload content.

## Message

```json
{
  "header": {
    "kind": "method_call",
    "serial": 7,
    "reply_serial": null,
    "sender": ":1.4",
    "destination": "ai.tinyhumans.openhuman.Voice",
    "path": "/ai/tinyhumans/openhuman/Voice",
    "interface": "ai.tinyhumans.openhuman.Voice",
    "member": "Transcribe",
    "error_name": null
  },
  "body": ["/tmp/clip.wav"]
}
```

Absent fields are **omitted**, not written as `null`. A reader must treat an
omitted field and a `null` field identically.

| Field | Type | Present on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | `method_call` \| `method_return` \| `error` \| `signal` | always |
| `serial` | u64, ≥ 1, per-sender monotonic | always |
| `reply_serial` | u64 | `method_return`, `error` |
| `sender` | bus name | stamped by the broker on everything it forwards |
| `destination` | bus name | `method_call`, `method_return`, `error` |
| `path` | object path | `method_call`, `signal` |
| `interface` | interface name | `method_call`, `signal` |
| `member` | member name | `method_call`, `signal` |
| `error_name` | dotted string | `error` |
| `confidential` | bool, omitted when false | `method_call`, `method_return` |

`body` is a positional JSON array for calls and signals, and a single JSON value
for returns. `error` bodies are a string: the human-readable message, without
the error name, which travels in `error_name`.

A peer **may** set `sender`; the broker overwrites it unconditionally. Nothing
downstream may trust a `sender` that did not come from the broker.

### `confidential`

A peer **may** set `confidential`, and the broker does **not** overwrite it. The
asymmetry with `sender` is deliberate: the flag can only cause more
restrictions, so a peer that sets it restricts its own traffic and nobody
else's.

A broker that sees it **must**:

- refuse a `signal` carrying it, and refuse any message carrying it without a
  `destination`;
- refuse a `method_call` carrying it unless the destination is a well-known name
  owned by a recipient the host has attested, replying
  `ai.tinyhumans.tinybus.Error.NotAttested`;
- never deliver the message to a match-rule subscriber, and never log its body.

A recipient is attested only by being an in-process module whose artifact the
host hashed against its allowlist before loading it. A peer reached across a
transport is never attested and so never receives a confidential message.

The field is optional and defaults to false, so an older broker parses the
message and routes it as an ordinary call. A sender that needs the guarantee
must therefore confirm it first, by calling `GetAttestation` and requiring a
non-null answer — a `null` answer, or an `UnknownMethod` error from a broker too
old to have the method, both mean the guarantee is unavailable.

`confidential` covers the body of the message carrying it, and a bulk stream is
not that body. A stream's bytes travel as separate `Stream.Write` calls (see
[Bulk streams](#bulk-streams)) which carry no `confidential` flag and are
therefore routed without an attestation check — putting a `StreamRef` in a
confidential call would protect the handle, not the payload it names.

A sender **must** therefore refuse to send a confidential message whose body
carries a stream handle, and tinybus does: the call fails locally, before the
message leaves the process. This is a rule for *senders*, not for brokers. A
broker cannot enforce it, because finding a handle means reading the body, and
reading a confidential body is precisely what the flag forbids — so a broker
never attempts it and never relies on peers having got it right.

There is still no confidential stream; a secret that must be attested has to fit
in the body of the call itself. What the refusal removes is the silent version
of that gap, where a caller believed otherwise.

## Names

| Kind | Grammar |
| --- | --- |
| Unique bus name | `:` then dot-separated runs of digits — `:1.7` |
| Well-known bus name | ≥ 2 dot-separated elements, each `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_-]*` |
| Interface name | as well-known bus name |
| Object path | `/`, or `/` then `/`-separated elements of `[A-Za-z0-9_]+` |
| Member name | `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*` |

Every component is capped at 255 bytes. Members admit no `.` so that a match
rule is unambiguous.

## The handshake

1. Connect.
2. Send `Hello` (see below). Send nothing else first.
3. The broker replies with your unique name as a JSON string.

A peer that calls anything before `Hello` has no unique name for the broker to
address a reply to.

## The bus's own interface

Destination `ai.tinyhumans.tinybus.Bus`, path `/ai/tinyhumans/tinybus/Bus`,
interface `ai.tinyhumans.tinybus.Bus`.

| Member | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Hello` | `[]` | your unique name |
| `GetId` | `[]` | the broker's id, stable for its process lifetime |
| `Ping` | `[]` | `null` |
| `RequestName` | `[name]` | `true`, or an error if taken |
| `ReleaseName` | `[name]` | `true` |
| `ListNames` | `[]` | every owned name, unique names included |
| `Announce` | `[manifest]` | `true`; records this peer's interface versions |
| `GetManifest` | `[name]` | that peer's manifest, or `null` |
| `ListPeers` | `[]` | unique names, owned names, and peer manifests |
| `GetNameOwner` | `[name]` | the owner's unique name, or `null` |
| `GetAttestation` | `[name]` | what the host verified about that owner, or `null` |
| `AddMatch` | `[rule]` | `null` |
| `RemoveMatch` | `[rule]` | `null` |
| `ListModules` | `[]` | every module known to the embedded host |
| `GetModule` | `[name]` | module identity, ABI facts and state, or `null` |
| `GetModuleManifest` | `[name]` | the declared module manifest, or `null` |
| `LoadModule` | `[path, config?]` | the newly loaded module record; config is JSON |
| `StopModule` | `[name, deadline_ms]` | the stopped module record |
| `EnableModule` | `[name, on]` | the updated module record |
| `RescanModules` | `[]`, `[paths]`, or `[paths, dry_run]` | modules loaded or inspected from configured/explicit search paths; `dry_run` defaults to `false` |

`ai.tinyhumans.tinybus.Bus` is reserved; `RequestName` for it always fails. So
does `RequestName` for a unique name.

When ownership changes, the bus emits `NameOwnerChanged`, with body
`[name, old_owner, new_owner]`, either owner being `null`. Unchanged ownership
emits no signal. This is how a peer learns a service died without polling it.

An embedded module host also exposes the additive module members above. A
broker built without the `modules` feature returns `UnknownMethod`; a
feature-enabled broker with no registered host returns `Failed` with "module
host is not installed". The wire protocol version remains 1 because old peers
can still parse every message. Module state changes are
announced as `ModuleStateChanged` with body
`[module, old_state, new_state, detail]`; `detail` is `null` unless the new
state has a safe refusal or fault reason.
Name ownership changes still announce when a module attaches or stops.

## Bulk streams

A payload larger than one frame does not travel in a body. The sender opens a
stream on the *receiving peer* and writes it as chunks; the method call carries
only a handle. The broker is not involved beyond routing — every member below is
an ordinary method call addressed to the receiving peer.

Path `/ai/tinyhumans/tinybus/Stream`, interface `ai.tinyhumans.tinybus.Stream`.
Every peer answers it, whether or not it exported anything.

| Member | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Open` | `[{"content_type"?, "total_len"?}]` | an opaque stream id |
| `Write` | `[id, seq, base64]` | `null` once the chunk is accepted |
| `Close` | `[id, total_len]` | `null`; `total_len` must equal what was written |
| `Abort` | `[id]` | `null` |

The handle that travels in a method body is
`{"id": …, "content_type"?: …, "len"?: …}`.

Rules a receiver enforces, and a sender must expect:

- **Chunks are capped at 524 288 bytes** before base64 — a chunk plus its
  encoding overhead must fit a frame with room to spare.
- **`seq` starts at 0 and increments by exactly one.** A gap aborts the stream
  rather than transposing it. Do not pipeline writes: two chunks in flight can
  be dispatched into two tasks and land either way round.
- **`Write` does not reply until the chunk has room** in the receiver's window.
  That reply is the flow control; a sender is never more than a window ahead.
  Like every call it has a deadline, so a receiver that stops reading surfaces
  as an error rather than a hang.
- **Only the peer that called `Open` may write to the stream.** Authorisation is
  the broker-stamped `sender` and nothing else. Any other peer gets
  `UnknownStream`, which is also what an id naming nothing returns — the two are
  deliberately indistinguishable.
- **`Close` declares the total.** A mismatch is an error and the payload is not
  delivered as a short read.
- **Limits belong to the receiver** and are not negotiated: a maximum stream
  length, a maximum number of concurrent streams per peer, a window, and an idle
  timeout after which an abandoned stream is reaped.

Send the call carrying the handle *before* writing the payload. The window is a
few megabytes, so a sender that writes everything up front stalls against a
reader that has not been dispatched yet.

## Match rules

Comma-separated `key=value`. Unset keys match anything; every set key must
match. Values are unquoted and cannot contain a comma — no name grammar admits
one.

```
type=signal,interface=ai.tinyhumans.openhuman.Mail,member=Received
type=signal,path_namespace=/ai/tinyhumans/openhuman/Mail
sender=ai.tinyhumans.tinybus.Bus,member=NameOwnerChanged
```

Keys: `type`, `sender`, `interface`, `member`, `path`, `path_namespace`. An
unknown key is an error, not an ignored clause — silently dropping one would
*widen* a subscription the peer asked to narrow.

A signal is never delivered back to the peer that emitted it.

## Errors

An `error` reply carries `error_name` and a string body. Callers match on
`error_name`, which is stable; the body is prose and may be reworded.

Bus-generated names:

| Name | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `…Error.NameHasNoOwner` | nothing owns the destination — the service is not running |
| `…Error.NameTaken` | `RequestName` lost |
| `…Error.UnknownObject` | the peer exports no object at that path |
| `…Error.UnknownInterface` | the object does not implement that interface |
| `…Error.UnknownMethod` | the interface has no such member |
| `…Error.BadArguments` | the body did not match the member's signature |
| `…Error.Failed` | a method failed with no more specific mapping |
| `…Error.UnknownStream` | no such stream, or not one this peer opened |
| `…Error.StreamAborted` | the stream ended before it was complete |
| `…Error.StreamTooLarge` | the stream exceeds what the receiver accepts |
| `…Error.TooManyStreams` | this peer already holds its share of open streams |

(`…` is `ai.tinyhumans.tinybus`.) A service should define its own dotted names
under its own interface — `ai.tinyhumans.openhuman.Voice.Error.NoDevice` — for
anything a caller might reasonably branch on.

An error message must never contain the value that caused it. Bodies carry
credentials.
