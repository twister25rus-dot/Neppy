//! The crate error type and its `Result` alias.
//!
//! Every fallible function in tinybus returns [`Result<T>`]. Two things make
//! this error type unusual, and both are deliberate:
//!
//! 1. It round-trips the wire. A method call that fails in a service process
//!    has to arrive back at the caller as an error, not as a successful reply
//!    containing a sad-looking value — so [`Error::MethodFailed`] carries a
//!    stable `name` (`ai.tinyhumans.tinybus.Error.UnknownMethod`) that a caller
//!    can match on across a process boundary, plus prose for humans.
//! 2. It never carries the payload that caused it. Bodies routinely hold
//!    OAuth tokens, mail contents and wallet material; a `Debug`-printed
//!    message in a log is an exfiltration path. Errors name the *member* and
//!    the *type*, never the value.
