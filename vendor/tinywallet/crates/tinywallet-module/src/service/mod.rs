//! `TinyBus` service boundary for the wallet surface.
//!
//! One object, `/ai/tinyhumans/tinywallet/Wallet`, exporting two flows:
//!
//! ```text
//! // The host holds the key.
//! BuildUnsigned(SigningRequest)   -> UnsignedTransaction
//! AttachSignature(AttachRequest)  -> SignedTransaction
//!
//! // This module holds the key. Confidential calls only.
//! DeriveAccount(SecretMaterial)   -> DerivedAccount
//! SignTransaction(SignRequest)    -> SignedTransaction
//! ExportKey(ExportRequest)        -> ExportedKey
//! SignMessage(SignMessageRequest) -> Signature
//! ```
//!
//! # Two flows, because there are two kinds of host
//!
//! The first pair keeps the key in the host: it asks what needs signing, signs
//! locally, and hands back only a signature. That is the right arrangement
//! whenever the backend is *reachable* — a service in its own process, across a
//! socket — and the only one available when the bus cannot say what is on the
//! other end.
//!
//! The second set exists because tinybus can now say. A confidential message is
//! delivered to a module whose artifact the host hashed against a digest an
//! operator asserted, or to nobody: never to a transport peer, never fanned out
//! to a subscriber, never printed by a monitor. For a host that loads this
//! module that is strictly better — it stops linking the derivation and signing
//! stack at all, and the key stops being reassembled in a process whose main job
//! is something else.
//!
//! **This is admission control, not isolation.** A loaded module shares the
//! host's address space and can read host memory directly; it never needed the
//! bus to reach a secret. What the rule buys is that the bus will not be the
//! delivery mechanism for code nobody allowlisted. Neither flow is deprecated,
//! and a backend whose compromise must not reach a key belongs in a separate
//! process — where it is ineligible for the second set by construction.
//!
//! # No state between calls, in either flow
//!
//! A confidential call is one method, not two, for the same reason
//! `AttachSignature` re-sends its fields: a module that held key material
//! between calls would need a store, a bound on it, and an expiry for callers
//! that never return. `SignTransaction` derives, builds, signs and assembles
//! before it returns, so there is no window to bound.
//!
//! Rebuilding rather than remembering is safe because building is
//! deterministic: the same fields yield the transaction the digests were
//! computed over.
//!
//! # Everything travels inline
//!
//! This is the significant difference from the `tinydocs` module, and it is
//! what makes this one small. A `TinyBus` frame is JSON capped at 16 MiB, where
//! a byte array costs about 3.5 bytes per byte — a real constraint for a
//! generated `.docx`, and irrelevant here. The largest thing that crosses is a
//! Bitcoin spend's UTXO list; a wallet with a thousand of them is still tens of
//! kilobytes. So there are no streams, no chunking, and no held outputs.
//!
//! # Errors are named, and the names are the contract
//!
//! A host maps them onto what a user or a model can act on: a rejected input it
//! can fix, against a failure it cannot. Anything unrecognised must be treated
//! as the second — telling a model its input was wrong when it was not sends it
//! into a rewrite loop over something that was already correct.
