//! The wire contract between a host and a signing backend.
//!
//! # Why this module exists, and why it has no dependencies
//!
//! A host can run this crate's transaction building in-process, or it can run
//! it somewhere else — most usefully in a loadable module, so the chain
//! libraries that building requires (`bitcoin` and its native `secp256k1`
//! build, above all) are absent from the host binary entirely.
//!
//! For that second arrangement both sides must agree on a set of types, and
//! **only the host side may be free of the heavy dependencies**. So these types
//! live outside every format gate and pull in nothing but `serde`: a host can
//! take this crate with `default-features = false`, get the whole contract, and
//! still not link a single chain library. It is the same carve-out
//! `tinydocs::spec` makes for documents.
//!
//! # The split: building is not signing
//!
//! Every type here exists to serve one rule — **key material never crosses this
//! boundary**. A backend receives transaction fields and returns the bytes that
//! need signing; the host signs them; the backend reassembles. Two round trips
//! instead of one, in exchange for a private key that never leaves the process
//! that owns it.
//!
//! That constraint is what shapes the API. A [`SigningRequest`] carries no
//! secret, and an [`AttachRequest`] carries the original fields **again**
//! alongside the signatures, rather than a handle to something the backend
//! remembered. A backend holding half-built transactions between calls would
//! need a store, bounds on that store, and an expiry policy for callers that
//! never come back — all of which is avoided by rebuilding. Building is
//! deterministic, so rebuilding from the same fields yields the same
//! transaction the digests were computed over.
//!
//! # Signature shapes
//!
//! Three of the four chains sign a 32-byte digest with secp256k1 ECDSA and need
//! the recovery id; Solana signs the message itself with ed25519 and does not.
//! [`Signature`] is an enum over exactly those two cases rather than a bag of
//! bytes, so a host cannot hand back an ed25519 signature for an EVM
//! transaction and have it fail somewhere deep in reassembly.

//
// Everything above exists so that key material never crosses this boundary.

// The split above is right whenever the backend is *reachable*: a service in
// its own process, across a socket, on another host. It is also the only option
// when the bus cannot say what is on the other end.
//
// tinybus can now say. A confidential message is delivered to a module whose
// artifact the host hashed against a digest an operator asserted, or to nobody
// at all — never to a transport peer, never fanned out to a subscriber, never
// printed by a monitor. That makes a second arrangement possible for a *loaded*
// backend, and it is strictly better where it applies: the host stops linking
// the derivation and signing stack at all, and the key stops being reassembled
// in a process whose job is the user interface.
//
// It is worth being exact about what this does and does not buy, because the
// temptation is to read it as isolation. A loaded module shares the host's
// address space and can read host memory directly — it never needed the bus to
// reach a secret. What the rule buys is that the bus will not be the *delivery
// mechanism* for code nobody allowlisted. A backend whose compromise must not
// reach a key belongs in a separate process, where this design makes it
// ineligible to receive one, and where the types above are the ones to use.
