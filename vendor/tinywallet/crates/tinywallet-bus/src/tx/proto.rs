//! The sliver of protobuf wire format a Tron transaction actually needs.
//!
//! Tron has the node build a transaction and hand it back, so a client that
//! signs what it is given signs whatever a compromised endpoint chose to
//! return. Checking it means reading the `raw_data` bytes — and `raw_data` is
//! protobuf.
//!
//! A full protobuf implementation is a schema compiler plus a runtime. What is
//! needed here is a reader for four wire types over a message whose shape is
//! already known, which is why this is ~120 lines of `&[u8]` walking rather
//! than a `prost` dependency and a `build.rs`. The parser is deliberately
//! *structural*: it recovers field numbers and their raw values and stops
//! there, leaving the meaning of field 11 to [`super::tron`].
//!
//! It borrows throughout — [`Value::Bytes`] points into the caller's buffer —
//! so parsing a nested message costs no allocation beyond the field vector.
//!
//! # Strictness
//!
//! Every accessor here is *singular*: it refuses a field that repeats rather
//! than taking the first or the last. That is not pedantry about the spec,
//! which does permit repetition. It is that "last one wins" is exactly how a
//! malicious node smuggles a second recipient past a checker that reads the
//! first — so a repeated singular field is treated as the attack it would be,
//! not as a value to disambiguate.
