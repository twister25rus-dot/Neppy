//! The sliver of Ethereum ABI encoding a wallet actually needs.
//!
//! Exactly one call is encoded here — ERC-20 `transfer(address,uint256)` — and
//! that is deliberate. A general ABI encoder is a parser for a type grammar; a
//! token transfer is a four-byte selector followed by two 32-byte words. Taking
//! a full Ethereum library for the second is how a wallet ends up carrying the
//! first, along with a bignum type and a signer stack.
//!
//! This lives outside the `tx` gate on purpose. Calldata is an *input* to
//! building a transaction, so a host that has moved building into a loadable
//! module still needs to produce it — and would otherwise have to pay a bus
//! round trip for keccak over 68 bytes, or link the chain library it just spent
//! the effort removing.
