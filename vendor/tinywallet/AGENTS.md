# Repository Guidelines

This file is the single source of truth for how humans and coding agents work
in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file, so every agent reads
the same instructions.

When you generate a new project from this template, keep this file and adapt
the project-specific parts (crate name, module map, feature flags, commands).
Delete guidance that no longer applies rather than leaving it to rot.

## Template Checklist

Do this once, in a single commit, before writing feature code:

- [ ] Set `name`, `description`, `repository`, `keywords`, and `categories` in
      `Cargo.toml`.
- [ ] Rename the crate references in `README.md`, `src/lib.rs`, `examples/`,
      and `tests/` (search for `rust_template` and `rust-template`).
- [ ] Replace the placeholder `greeting` module with the first real feature
      area, keeping the `mod.rs` / `types.rs` / `test.rs` layout.
- [ ] Confirm `license` and `LICENSE` match the project's intended license.
- [ ] Update the security contact in `SECURITY.md`.
- [ ] Replace `ROADMAP.md` with the real plan, or delete it.
- [ ] Decide whether the project uses TinyBus. Keep `vendor/tinybus` pinned and
      wire the required crate/features, or remove the submodule deliberately.
- [ ] Rewrite the "Project Structure" section below to describe this crate.

## Project Structure

This is a Rust 2024 library crate rooted at `Cargo.toml`.

```text
src/
├── lib.rs              # crate docs + the entire public re-export surface
├── error/mod.rs        # crate-wide `Error` and `Result<T>`
└── <feature>/          # one directory per feature area
    ├── mod.rs          # module docs, wiring, smallest useful public API
    ├── types.rs        # substantial type definitions
    └── test.rs         # module-local unit tests
tests/                  # integration tests against the public API only
examples/               # runnable, compiled-in-CI usage examples
vendor/tinybus/         # pinned TinyBus source; optional until wired by a project
docs/
├── specs/              # behavior and architecture specifications
├── plans/              # test-first implementation plans
└── adr/                # immutable architecture decision records
```

Each feature area belongs in a focused module directory under `src/`. A module
root explains the module, wires its pieces together, and exposes the smallest
useful API. Move substantial type definitions into `types.rs` and put
module-local unit tests in a dedicated `test.rs`, wired from the bottom of the
module root with:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod test;
```

Do not accumulate inline `mod tests` blocks in implementation files, and do not
let a general-purpose `utils.rs` or `helpers.rs` grow — those are a symptom of a
missing module. Prefer many small modules that each do one thing well over few
broad ones.

Keep public exports centralized in `src/lib.rs` so downstream users have one
predictable surface. Put shared error variants in `src/error/mod.rs` and return
the crate-wide `Result<T>` from fallible public APIs.

## Build And Test

Run every command from the repository root. These four are the contract; CI
runs exactly them, so a green local run should mean a green CI run.

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo build --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --all-features
```

Supporting commands:

- `cargo fmt --all` — format before committing.
- `cargo test <filter>` — run a focused subset while iterating.
- `cargo run --example basic` — run the bundled example.
- `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features` — build the rustdoc CI also builds with
  `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"`.
- `cargo test --doc` — run doctests alone when editing documentation examples.

Never skip, ignore, or delete a failing test to make a command pass. Fix the
root cause, or stop and report the blocker.

## Coding Style

Use standard `rustfmt` output and Rust 2024 idioms. Do not hand-format around
`rustfmt`, and do not add `#[rustfmt::skip]` without a comment explaining why.

- `snake_case` for modules, files, functions, methods, fields, and locals.
- `PascalCase` for types, traits, and enum variants; `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for
  constants and statics.
- Name things for what they are, not for their layer: `RetryPolicy`, not
  `RetryHelper`.
- Prefer small, typed APIs over stringly-typed ones. Accept `&str` and generic
  `impl Into<String>` at boundaries; return owned, concrete types.
- Keep the public surface minimal: default to private, and export deliberately
  from `src/lib.rs`.
- `unsafe` is forbidden crate-wide by the lint configuration in `Cargo.toml`.
  If a project genuinely needs it, relax the lint in its own commit and document
  every invariant with a `// SAFETY:` comment.

### Errors

- One crate-wide `Error` enum in `src/error/mod.rs`, built with `thiserror`.
- Fallible public functions return `Result<T>`, the crate alias.
- Add a specific variant instead of stuffing context into a string; error
  messages are lowercase, without trailing punctuation.
- Do not `unwrap()`, `expect()`, or `panic!` in library code paths. They are
  fine in tests, examples, and genuinely unreachable states — where `expect`
  must carry a message explaining the invariant.
- Document a `# Errors` section on every public fallible function and a
  `# Panics` section on anything that can panic.

### Dependencies

Adding a dependency is a design decision. Before adding one, check whether the
standard library or an existing dependency already covers the need. When you do
add one:

- pin a caret range (`serde = "1"`), not an exact version;
- enable only the features you need, with `default-features = false` when that
  meaningfully trims the tree;
- gate anything optional behind a Cargo feature, documented in `Cargo.toml`;
- leave a comment above the entry explaining *why* the crate is needed and what
  uses it — see the existing entries for the expected tone;
- prefer well-maintained crates with a compatible license.

Keep `Cargo.lock` committed; this crate ships a lockfile so CI and releases are
reproducible.

### Vendored dependencies

TinyBus is registered as the `vendor/tinybus` git submodule and pinned by its
gitlink. Initialize it after cloning with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Do not edit vendored code from the parent repository. Make TinyBus changes in
its own repository, push them there, then update this repository's gitlink in a
separate commit. If the generated project consumes TinyBus, use the exact crate
path and minimal features it needs; the template does not force that dependency
on every generated crate.

## Testing

- Module-local unit tests live in `src/<feature>/test.rs` and may touch private
  items.
- Integration tests live in `tests/` and exercise only the public API — they are
  the regression suite for the crate's contract.
- Use descriptive, behavioral test names: `rejects_an_empty_name`, not
  `test_greet_2`.
- Cover the failure paths, not just the happy path. Every new error variant
  needs a test that produces it.
- For async behavior, standardize on one runtime (`tokio` as a dev-dependency
  for tests) rather than mixing runtimes.
- Tests must be deterministic and independent of network, wall-clock time, and
  execution order. Gate any live/network test behind a feature or an env var and
  name it `live_*` so it is easy to exclude.
- Maintain at least 80% coverage of meaningful library behavior. Add or update
  tests with every behavior change, and note any deliberately untested edge case
  in the pull request description.

Write the test first when fixing a bug: a failing test that reproduces the
report, then the fix that turns it green.

## Documentation

Write documentation for the reader who has never seen the code.

- Every public item gets a rustdoc comment. `missing_docs` is a warning that CI
  treats as an error.
- Start every `mod.rs` and `test.rs` with a concise module-level `//!`
  description.
- `src/lib.rs` carries the crate-level overview: what the crate does, the
  primary entry points, and a short runnable example.
- Prefer concrete examples over vague description. Doc examples are compiled and
  run by `cargo test`, so they cannot drift.
- Complex modules must include a module-level `README.md` covering their design,
  public surface, and important operational constraints.
- Keep `README.md`, `docs/`, and module docs aligned with code changes in the
  same commit that changes behavior.
- Write accepted behavior and constraints in `docs/specs/` before creating a
  linked, implementation-ordered plan in `docs/plans/`. Specs define what and
  why; plans define how and in what sequence.
- Keep every Markdown file, including this one, at 500 lines or fewer. When a
  topic outgrows that, split it into focused files and link them from the
  nearest `README.md`.

## Git Workflow

- Never commit directly to `main`. Branch first, one branch per logical change.
- Do feature work in a git worktree so the main checkout stays clean.
- Commit subjects are concise and imperative: `Add retry policy to the client`.
  Keep the subject specific to the change and under ~72 characters.
- Make small, focused commits. Each commit should cover one logical change,
  build independently, and avoid mixing formatting, refactors, and behavior
  changes unless they are inseparable.
- Never commit secrets. `.env` is git-ignored; document new variables in
  `.env.example` with placeholder values.
- Never force-push a shared branch, rewrite published history, or bypass hooks
  with `--no-verify`.

## Pull Requests

Open pull requests ready for review, not as drafts, unless the work genuinely
must not merge yet. A pull request should:

- summarize what changed and why, in a few sentences;
- call out public API or behavior changes explicitly, or state "None";
- list the validation commands actually run, with their outcome;
- link the related issue;
- include updated tests, docs, and examples in the same change.

The template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` encodes this checklist.
Address review feedback by fixing it, and reply on each thread describing what
changed. Do not resolve a thread whose feedback you have not addressed or
explicitly declined with a reason.

## Releases

Releases run from `.github/workflows/release.yml` via a manual
`workflow_dispatch` with a `patch` / `minor` / `major` bump. The workflow
re-runs the full validation suite, computes the next version, updates
`Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`, commits and tags `vX.Y.Z`, packages, pushes, and
publishes to crates.io using the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret.

Consequently:

- Do not hand-edit the `version` field in `Cargo.toml`; the release workflow
  owns it.
- Follow semantic versioning. Any change to the public surface that is not
  purely additive is a breaking change and needs a major bump (pre-1.0: a minor
  bump).
- The crate must be publishable at all times — `main` should always be green.

## Agent Working Agreement

For automated contributors specifically:

1. **Read before writing.** Inspect the surrounding module and match its
   conventions, comment density, and idiom rather than importing a house style.
2. **Verify, do not assume.** Run the four contract commands and read their
   output before reporting a task complete. Report failures with the output;
   never claim a check passed that you did not run.
3. **Stay in scope.** Implement what was asked. Do not opportunistically
   refactor, reformat, upgrade dependencies, or "fix" unrelated code — raise it
   instead.
4. **No placeholders in delivered code.** No `todo!()`, no stubbed functions, no
   commented-out alternatives left behind. If something cannot be finished, say
   so explicitly.
5. **Do not weaken the guardrails.** Never add blanket `#[allow(...)]`, relax a
   lint, mark a test `#[ignore]`, or loosen CI to get a green run. Fix the
   cause.
6. **Secrets stay out.** Never read, echo, or commit `.env` contents, tokens, or
   credentials, and never paste them into a pull request or issue.
7. **Ask only when blocked.** Make routine judgment calls yourself; escalate
   only irreversible decisions or genuine forks with no clear default.
