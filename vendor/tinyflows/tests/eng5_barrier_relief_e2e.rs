#![cfg(feature = "mock")]
//! Eng §5 regression: the mixed fan-in barrier deadlock and its
//! `BarrierRelief`-based fix.
//!
//! A fan-in (`merge`) node with more than one predecessor is lowered as an
//! all-waiting barrier (see `src/engine.rs`'s edge-lowering loop) so a
//! downstream merge never fires off a stale superstep snapshot before a
//! *taken* conditional branch's items have committed (the data-loss failure
//! mode a plain edge would reintroduce). But when one predecessor is only
//! reachable via a conditional branch that this run does *not* take, that
//! predecessor never arrives on its own — without a relief, the barrier
//! would wait for it forever.
//!
//! These tests build the mixed fan-in repro graph directly (one
//! unconditionally-reachable predecessor `c`, one conditional-only
//! predecessor `a`) and assert both directions: the untaken-branch case must
//! not deadlock (guarded by a `tokio::time::timeout` so a regression fails
//! fast instead of hanging the suite), and the taken-branch case must not
//! lose `a`'s item. Two more tests pin the pure-conditional-join and
//! pure-unconditional-fan-in cases the old `is_conditional_join` special-cased,
//! now handled uniformly by `conditional_predecessors` + `BarrierRelief`.
//!
//! Gated behind the `mock` cargo feature, so plain `cargo test` skips it while
//! `cargo test --all-features` runs it (mirrors `branching_e2e.rs` /
//! `hardening_branching_e2e.rs`).
