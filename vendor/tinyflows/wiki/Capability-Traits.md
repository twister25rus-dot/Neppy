# Capability Traits

tinyflows is **host-agnostic**: the crate never hard-codes an LLM, tool, HTTP,
code, or persistence vendor. Everything that touches the outside world is
expressed as a trait the **embedding host implements**. This is the core design
constraint — new outside-world effects go through a capability trait, not a direct
dependency.

The host constructs these implementations and hands them to the engine per run.
Deterministic, in-memory mocks ship behind the `mock` feature
(`caps::mock::mock_capabilities()`) so workflows run end-to-end in tests and
examples without any real backend.

## The traits

| Trait | Used by | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `LlmProvider` | `agent`, `output_parser` | Runs a single LLM completion from a JSON request, returning JSON. |
| `ToolInvoker` | `tool_call` | Invokes a named integration action (`slug` + `args`), returning its output. |
| `HttpClient` | `http_request` | Issues an outbound HTTP request described by JSON, returning the response. |
| `CodeRunner` | `code` | Executes sandboxed user code (`CodeLanguage::JavaScript` / `Python`) with a JSON input. |
| `ShellRunner` | `shell` | Runs a shell script (inline or by path) with a working directory and environment, returning its exit code, stdout, and stderr. Optional: `None` refuses `shell` nodes. |
| `StateStore` | resumable / stateful workflows | Durable key/value state (`load` / `store`) for a run. |
| `ApprovalProvider` | `approval` | Puts a subject (a URL, a draft, a payload) in front of a human and reports their approve/reject. Optional: with `None`, an `approval` node pauses the run instead and the host settles it via `engine::resume`. |

## Connection references

`LlmProvider`, `ToolInvoker`, and `HttpClient` each take an optional `conn: Option<&str>`
— an **opaque, host-managed connection reference** (e.g. a credential or Composio
connection id) that names the account a call acts as. The crate never sees real
secrets; the host resolves the reference to credentials inside its implementation.

## Data-binding in config

The capability-backed integration nodes (`agent`, `tool_call`, `http_request`)
resolve `=` expressions embedded anywhere in their config before the config
reaches the host implementation. Each expression is evaluated against the
`{ item, items, run }` scope — the node's first input item, all of its input
items, and the run payload — so a node can bind upstream output straight into its
parameters (e.g. `args: { "text": "=item.name" }`). Values that do not start with
`=` pass through as literals, so existing config is unaffected.

## The `Capabilities` bundle

The engine receives a `Capabilities` struct — the per-run bundle of host
implementations. It bundles six host capabilities: `llm`, `tools`, `http`,
`code`, `state`, and the optional `approvals` (`Option<Arc<dyn
ApprovalProvider>>`) each an `Arc<dyn Trait>` (or `Option` of one, for
`approvals`). Nodes reach each one through `ctx.caps` during execution — for
example, durable key/value state via `ctx.caps.state`, and a human review via
`ctx.caps.approvals`. A host that builds `Capabilities` with a struct literal
must add an `approvals` field (`None` if it wires no provider) to keep
compiling.

An `approval` node needs an identity for its review: either an explicit
`request_id` in its own config, or — the common case, since a graph is
authored once and run many times — `RunInput::with_run_id("...")` on the run,
which the node falls back to as `"<run id>:<node id>"`. A node with neither
has nothing stable to key the review on and refuses to run rather than
guessing; it does not silently fall back to the bare node id, which would let
a later run of the same graph reuse an earlier run's decision. Use a
**server-generated** run id, never a caller-supplied field — it is the key
reviews are de-duplicated on.

`ApprovalProvider::decide` is **create-or-fetch**, keyed on
`ApprovalRequest::request_id`: the first call with an id creates the review, and
every later call with that id reports where *that* review stands. This matters
because an interrupt discards the activation's state update, so the node re-asks
after every resume and on every poll — a provider that created a fresh review per
call would notify the reviewer once per call.

Durable, cross-process human-in-the-loop resume is available by implementing
`Checkpointer<serde_json::Value>` and driving the run via
`engine::run_with_checkpointer` / `resume_with_checkpointer` under a stable
`thread_id`: a run can persist its paused approval boundary to the host's store
and resume later, even after a process restart. The in-process `run_resumable`
remains the simple, non-durable path.
