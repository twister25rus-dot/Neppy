/// Host-injected memory access for `memory` nodes.

/// A `memory` node is a **delivery surface** onto whatever durable memory store
/// the host already maintains — it exposes no capability of its own. Six config
/// `operation`s map onto five trait methods:
///
/// - `recall` and `search` both call [`recall`](Self::recall); `search` passes
///   `opts.operation == "search"` (alongside the same `query`) so a host that
///   distinguishes semantic recall from full-text search can branch on it, but
///   a host that treats them identically may ignore the distinction entirely.
///   This keeps the trait small (one read-with-a-query method rather than two
///   near-duplicates) while still letting `opts` carry the distinction through
///   to the host.
/// - `flavour` and `people` are read-only lookups with no free-text `query`
///   requirement, each with its own method.
/// - `remember` and `forget` are the two write operations.
///
/// `scope` is an opaque, host-defined string (the model layer never interprets
/// it) but the wire contract in practice is `"user"` (the caller's durable,
/// cross-flow memory — read-only from a workflow), `"flow"` (this flow's own
/// memory — the only scope `remember`/`forget` may target), and `"flows"`
/// (cross-flow read access — read-only). [`crate::validate`] enforces the hard
/// invariant that a `remember`/`forget` operation may never carry
/// `scope: "user"`, structurally, before a run ever starts — that boundary is
/// NOT re-checked here, so a host implementing this trait directly (bypassing
/// the node + validator) must not treat that check as already done.
///
/// This capability is **optional**, matching the [`AgentRunner`] precedent:
/// hosts without a memory store leave [`Capabilities::memory`] `None`, and a
/// `memory` node then fails at run time with a capability error rather than
/// silently no-opping (there is no meaningful fallback for a read/write memory
