//! Checks that run before an authoring write lands.
//!
//! [`validate`](crate::validate) answers "would this compile" — no trigger, an
//! edge to a node that is not there. That is a real bar and it is not the one
//! authors keep failing. The graphs that cost people an afternoon *do* compile:
//! they have a binding that resolves to null at run time, so a step executes
//! with an empty value and the run reports success having done nothing.
//!
//! Nothing downstream catches that. A null is a legal value, so the engine has
//! no complaint; the run record shows every node green. The only place it can be
//! caught is here, before the write, while there is still an author on the other
//! end to tell.
//!
//! Two rules the gates hold themselves to:
//!
//! - **Refuse only what is *guaranteed* wrong.** A gate that fires on a graph
//!   that would have worked costs an author their edit and teaches them to
//!   distrust the tool. Everything merely suspicious belongs in a dry run's
//!   diagnostics, which advise rather than refuse.
//! - **Say what to do.** Every message names the node, the binding, and the
//!   correction. The reader is often an agent with one round trip to spend.
//!
//! # What is *not* here
//!
//! Anything that depends on a host's own vocabulary. Which harnesses exist,
//! which tool slugs resolve, which integrations are installed — a gate over any
//! of those would have to hard-code a host, which this crate does not do. A host
//! adds its own by implementing
//! [`HostPolicy::check_graph`](crate::store::HostPolicy::check_graph), whose
//! default is exactly [`failures`] below.
