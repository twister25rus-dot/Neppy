//! Background drain worker for durable event sinks.
//!
//! Durable sinks implement the *synchronous* `EventListener`/`GraphEventSink`
//! hooks but persist through *async* journal/store APIs. Bridging that boundary
//! inline with `futures::executor::block_on` blocked a tokio worker thread for
//! the whole append (a file write, in the worst case) on the run's critical
//! path, and risked a deadlock on a current-thread runtime.
//!
//! [`AppendWorker`] moves persistence off the emitting thread entirely: each
//! `submit` pushes the payload onto a **bounded** channel that a dedicated
//! background thread drains, awaiting the append on its own single-thread
//! runtime.
//!
//! # Backpressure & drop policy
//! The channel is bounded (see [`DEFAULT_DRAIN_CAPACITY`]). `submit` never
//! blocks the emitting thread: if the queue is full the observation is
//! **dropped** and counted in [`AppendWorker::dropped`], trading completeness
//! of the durable log for run latency (a slow or stuck backend must never stall
//! the run). Callers that need a lossless log can inspect the dropped count.
//!
//! # Error policy
//! Append errors are **not** silently discarded, but neither are they allowed to
//! flood the host's log. Every failed append is counted in
//! [`AppendWorker::append_failures`] (a lifetime total, distinct from the
//! queue-full [`AppendWorker::dropped`] count), and the drain loop reports
//! through `tracing` on the `tinyflows::graph` target with a `sink`
//! field:
//!
//! - the **first** failure of a failure run is reported at `ERROR` — durable
//!   observations are being lost;
//! - subsequent failures are counted silently, with a reminder at `WARN` at most
//!   once per [`APPEND_REPORT_COOLDOWN`]; each reminder carries the *latest*
//!   error, so a changed cause (read-only volume → full disk) still surfaces
//!   within one cooldown;
//! - the first success after a failure run emits one `WARN` recovery summary
//!   carrying how many observations were lost while the sink was down;
//! - if the worker shuts down while still failing, it emits one final `WARN`
//!   summary so a never-recovering run is not silently quiet.
//!
//! The worker keeps attempting every item while degraded: the attempt *is* the
//! recovery detector, it runs off the run's critical path, and skipping it would
//! turn a transient blip into guaranteed loss of everything still queued. Items
//! that fail are lost, but counted.
//!
//! Persistence remains best-effort — an error never propagates back into the run
//! — but it is observable. Note that reporting goes through `tracing`, so an
//! embedder with no subscriber installed sees nothing at all: installing one is
//! how a host observes durable-log loss. [`AppendWorker::append_failures`]
//! counts it, but — like the queue-full [`AppendWorker::dropped`] count it
//! mirrors — it is crate-internal and is not reachable from a host application
//! through [`JournalSink`](super::JournalSink) or
//! [`JsonlSink`](super::JsonlSink).
//!
//! # Ordering & durability boundary
//! A single drain thread preserves submit order. [`AppendWorker::flush`] blocks
//! until every payload queued so far has been persisted, and `Drop` flushes
//! before tearing the thread down, so no buffered observation is lost on a
//! graceful shutdown.
