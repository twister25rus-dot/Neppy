//! Checkpointer trait and in-memory backend — the durability layer that makes
//! the recursive graph runtime resumable and time-travelable.
//!
//! In a recursive-language-model harness, runs nest: a graph node can run
//! another compiled graph, which can run another, each producing its own state.
//! Checkpointing snapshots every level of that tree at superstep boundaries and
//! keys them by `thread_id`/`namespace` so a parent and its embedded subgraphs
//! never collide (see [`crate::graph::subgraph`]). Persisting committed state at
//! each boundary is what lets a run be paused on an interrupt, resumed later,
//! forked, or replayed for time-travel debugging.
//!
//! See [`types`] for the checkpoint record definitions. Checkpoints are written
//! at superstep boundaries only — never mid-node — so resuming always reruns a
//! node from its start.
