//! Run/step observability records and the host-facing [`RunObserver`] hook.
//!
//! tinyflows **emits** structured records of what happened during a run; the
//! host **persists** and renders them — the crate never owns a database.
//! A [`Run`] captures one workflow
//! execution as a sequence of [`ExecutionStep`]s, one per non-trigger node
//! activation, each recording the node's status, output items, and wall-clock
//! duration.
//!
//! A host receives these live by implementing [`RunObserver`] and passing it to
//! [`crate::engine::run_with_observer`]. Every callback has a default no-op body,
//! so a host implements only the hooks it cares about. The default
//! [`crate::engine::run`] path installs a [`NoopObserver`], so observability adds
//! no cost unless a host opts in.
