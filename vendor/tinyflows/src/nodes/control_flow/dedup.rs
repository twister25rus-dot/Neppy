//! The `dedup` node: the **filter** half of a commit-on-success exactly-once
//! pattern.
//!
//! A `dedup` node drops an item whose per-item `config.key` (an `"=expr"`, e.g.
//! `"=item.id"`) has already been durably **committed** by a prior successful
//! run, and otherwise passes the item through while recording the key as
//! **tentative** — pending a decision this node never makes itself. Whether a
//! run's tentative keys get promoted to committed (success) or discarded
//! (failure) is entirely a host concern, driven off `StateStore` after the run
//! completes. This node is deliberately committer-agnostic: it only ever reads
//! `committed` and writes `tentative`.
//!
//! # Why this lives in `control_flow`, not `integration`
//!
//! Every other node in this module is pure — no host capability, just routing
//! and reshaping of in-flight data. `dedup` is the one exception: it reads and
//! writes [`StateStore`](crate::caps::StateStore) durable state. It sits here
//! anyway because *semantically* it is a filter over the data flow (like
//! `condition`/`split_out`), not a delivery surface onto an external system
//! (like `tool_call`/`memory`) — `StateStore` is closer to compiler-managed
//! run bookkeeping than to a capability an author is "calling out" to.
//!
//! # The `StateStore` contract (read this before writing a host subscriber)
//!
//! [`Capabilities::state`](crate::caps::Capabilities::state) is documented as
//! exact-key and durable; hosts additionally namespace it per-flow (so two
//! different saved flows never see each other's keys) *before* handing the
//! `StateStore` to the engine — this node does not know about, and does not
//! need to know about, that outer namespace. What this node DOES own is the
//! discriminator **within** a flow's namespace: two `dedup` nodes in the same
//! flow graph must never collide, so every key this node touches is prefixed
//! with its own [`Node::id`](crate::model::Node::id).
//!
//! For a `dedup` node with id `"<node_id>"`, exactly two `StateStore` keys
//! exist, built by [`committed_key`] and [`tentative_key`]:
//!
//! | Key | Written by | Read by | Meaning |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `dedup:<node_id>:committed` | the **host**, after a run succeeds | this node (every run) | keys proven seen — permanent |
//! | `dedup:<node_id>:tentative` | this node (every run with an unseen key) | the **host**, after a run finishes | keys passed *this* run, awaiting a commit/release decision |
//!
//! Each key's stored [`Value`] is a JSON array of strings (order not
//! meaningful; treat as a set) — chosen over per-member keys because
//! `StateStore` exposes no "list keys with prefix" or "delete by prefix"
//! operation, so one array under one key is the only shape a host can
//! atomically read-modify-write or clear in a single `load`/`store` round
//! trip.
//!
//! **The host-side contract this node depends on** (a `DedupCommitSubscriber`,
//! PR 2's job, not this crate's):
//! - **On run success**: for every `dedup` node that ran, union its
//!   `tentative` set into its `committed` set, then clear `tentative` (store
//!   `[]`, or delete the key if the store supports it) so a later run's load
//!   starts from empty. `committed` is APPEND-ONLY from this node's point of
//!   view — this node never removes a committed key.
//! - **On run failure**: clear (release) `tentative` for every `dedup` node
//!   that ran, WITHOUT touching `committed`. A released key is exactly as
//!   unseen as it was before the run — the next run may pass it through again.
//! - **This node commits nothing itself.** Directly inspecting `committed`
//!   after a run proves that: see
//!   `committed_set_is_never_mutated_by_the_node_itself` in this module's
//!   tests.
//!
//! # Runtime behavior (per item)
//!
//! 1. Resolve `config.key` against the item (same `"=expr"` resolver as
//!    `condition`/`memory`, via [`crate::nodes::resolve_config_traced_for_item`]).
//! 2. A key that resolves to `null`, is absent, or is an empty string
//!    **fails open**: the item passes through and is NOT recorded anywhere.
//!    An item is never silently dropped just because its key could not be
//!    computed — see [`resolve_key`].
//! 3. Otherwise, if the key is already in `committed` **or** was already seen
//!    earlier in this same batch, the item is dropped.
//! 4. Otherwise, the item passes through and the key is added to this run's
//!    tentative additions (written to `StateStore` once, after the batch).
//!
//! A duplicate key appearing twice in one run's input passes exactly once —
//! the first occurrence wins, later ones are dropped by the same rule as an
//! already-committed key (see `same_key_twice_in_one_run_passes_once_only`).
//!
//! # Ports
//!
//! Single `main` output, carrying only the items that passed (unseen). Unlike
//! `condition`'s `true`/`false`, [`NodeOutput`] carries one item list and one
//! optional port per execution — there is no way to emit the dropped items on
//! a second `skipped` port in the same call, so this node does not attempt
//! one; deduped-out items are simply absent from `main`. A host that wants
//! observability into what was dropped reads the debug log
//! (`[dedup] key already seen — dropping item`) or diffs input against output.
//!
//! # Key canonicalization
//!
//! `config.key` should resolve to a stable scalar id (issue number, message id,
//! url). A non-string scalar (`Number`/`Bool`) is canonicalized via its JSON
//! text so it still dedupes deterministically. An array/object also resolves to
//! its (deterministic) JSON text, but using a whole structure as a dedup key is
//! almost always an authoring mistake — prefer a scalar id. `resolve_key` does
//! not reject structured keys (they are deterministic, so a hard error would be
//! more surprising than useful), but authors should treat a structured key as a
//! smell.
//!
//! # Concurrency and the scope of the exactly-once guarantee
//!
//! `StateStore` exposes only `load`/`store` — there is **no** compare-and-swap
//! or atomic read-modify-write. The `tentative` write here (and the host's
//! `committed` union after the run) is therefore a `load` → merge → `store`
//! that is **not** safe against *two runs of the same flow overlapping in
//! time*: two concurrent `load`s can each miss the other's not-yet-stored keys,
//! and the later `store` wins (lost update).
//!
//! The exactly-once guarantee holds under the normal assumption that a given
//! saved flow has **at most one active run at a time** (the usual case: a
//! scheduled or singly-triggered flow). When two runs of the *same* flow truly
//! overlap, the failure is bounded and in the **safe direction**: a lost
//! tentative/committed key can only cause an item to be processed **again** on
//! a later run (an occasional duplicate — *under*-dedup), never to be wrongly
//! dropped (*over*-dedup). No item is ever silently lost.
//!
//! Closing this window fully requires an atomic `StateStore` primitive
//! (compare-and-swap or a per-key serialized update), which is a deliberate
//! **deferred** engine change — not added here because the current failure mode
//! is rare and benign. A host can already narrow the durable half of the race
//! by serializing its post-run `committed` update per flow id (the OpenHuman
//! `DedupCommitSubscriber` does exactly this).
