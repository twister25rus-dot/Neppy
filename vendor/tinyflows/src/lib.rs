//! Core library surface for **tinyflows** — a Rust-native workflow
//! engine.
//!
//! tinyflows models an automation as a [`model::WorkflowGraph`]: a directed graph
//! of typed [`model::Node`]s connected by [`model::Edge`]s. A [`compiler::compile`]
//! step validates the graph and (from stage A1) lowers it onto the
//! in-crate [`graph`](crate::graph) state-graph runtime, which
//! the [`engine::run`] entry point drives.
//!
//! The crate is deliberately **host-agnostic**: anything that touches the outside
//! world — LLM calls, integration tools, HTTP, code execution, persistence — is
//! expressed through the [`caps`] capability traits that the embedding
//! application implements.
//!
//! ```
//! assert_eq!(tinyflows::product_name(), "tinyflows");
