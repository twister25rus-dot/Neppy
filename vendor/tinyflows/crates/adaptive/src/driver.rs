//! Holding the pieces together, and driving an episode to an answer.
//!
//! Everything below this module is a free function taking seven or eight
//! arguments, which is right for a library and wearing to call. This bundles
//! them.
//!
//! # What is an instance, and what is a goal run
//!
//! These are different lifetimes and putting them in one object is the mistake
//! worth naming.
//!
//! A [`Loop`] is **per tenant**, long-lived, and holds only configuration and
//! adapters: a scoped ledger, a workflow store, capabilities, host facts, a
//! runner, a budget. Building one costs a database pool and an HTTP client, so
//! it is built once and shared.
//!
//! A **goal run is an episode id**, not an object. Its state — the goal, the
//! attempt number, the stall count, whether it finished — lives in the
//! [`Episode`] record in the ledger. Nothing about it is held here.
//!
//! That split is what makes two things true at once. Many goal runs share one
//! `Loop`, concurrently, because the `Loop` holds nothing per-episode. And an
//! episode survives the process running it: kill this one mid-run and
//! [`Ledger::episodes`] on the next boot hands back everything that was in
//! flight, each resumable from its own record by id.
//!
//! Had the instance *been* the goal run, both would be false — the config would
//! be rebuilt per goal, and a deploy would lose every episode's counters while
//! leaving its rows behind to look like progress.
