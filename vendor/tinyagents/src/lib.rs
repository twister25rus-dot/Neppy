//! # TinyAgents — a durable agent + graph harness for Rust
//!
//! TinyAgents is a typed, durable runtime where **language models call models,
//! agents call agents, and graphs run graphs** — and where a model can author,
//! compile, and run the very workflow it is standing inside, all as inspectable,
//! checkpointed, policy-checked Rust.
//!
//! The "recursive" framing is the through-line of the whole crate, not a
//! footnote: rather than stuffing everything into one context window, a model
//! treats long context as an external *environment* it decomposes, recursively
//! calling sub-models, sub-agents, and sub-graphs as functions. TinyAgents
//! brings that to Rust as a production-shaped harness (capability calls by
//! name, depth tracking, and trajectory/event logging). The *scripted* form of
//! that loop — an embedded interpreter running model-written code cells — is a
//! host concern built on these surfaces, not something this crate ships.
//!
//! ## The four surfaces
//!
//! 1. **Harness** ([`harness`]) — provider-neutral model calls, typed tools,
//!    middleware, structured output, streaming, usage/cost, retry/limits, cache,
//!    memory/embeddings, sub-agents, steering, and a testkit.
//! 2. **Graph runtime** ([`graph`]) — LangGraph-style durable typed state
//!    graphs: [`START`]/[`END`], nodes, conditional routing, [`Command`]s,
//!    fan-out, reducers/channels, [`Checkpoint`]s, [`Interrupt`]s, subgraphs,
//!    streaming, topology export, and per-thread productivity primitives — a
//!    durable [`ThreadGoal`] with graph-native continuation and a
//!    [`TaskBoard`] kanban — exposed as harness tools.
//! 3. **Registry** ([`registry`]) — a named capability catalog (models, tools,
//!    agents, graphs, stores, middleware, policy) that `.rag` binds by name.
//! 4. **Expressive language `.rag`** ([`language`]) — a declarative,
//!    side-effect-free blueprint format that compiles (lexer → parser →
//!    compiler) into the same graph/harness runtime; the safe boundary for
//!    agent-authored plans.
//!
//! ## The recursion story
//!
//! `.rag` lowers into the *same* [`graph`] + [`harness`] types
//! as hand-written Rust — a language whose programs are the runtime that
//! interprets them. A harness agent can be exposed *as a tool* to another agent
//! ([`SubAgent`], [`SubAgentTool`], [`SubAgentSession`]), so orchestration is
//! just a model calling a model; the runtime tracks parent/child run lineage and
//! enforces a recursion cap ([`TinyAgentsError::SubAgentDepth`]). At the deepest
//! level a model can emit a `.rag` blueprint that compiles through the same
//! registry-bound path as a human-authored file and runs on the same runtime the
//! model is already executing in (see `examples/openai_self_blueprint.rs`).
//!
//! ## Provider features
//!
//! Hosted and local providers (OpenAI plus the OpenAI-compatible endpoints for
//! Anthropic, Ollama, DeepSeek, Groq, xAI, OpenRouter, Together, and Mistral)
//! are compiled in unconditionally alongside the offline, deterministic
//! [`harness::providers::MockModel`]. Two Cargo features gate optional,
//! heavier dependencies instead: `sqlite` (embedded SQLite checkpointer,
//! [`graph::checkpoint::SqliteCheckpointer`]) and `tools` (the builtin generic
//! tool family, [`harness::tools`]).
//!
//! Scripted, imperative orchestration surfaces (an embedded interpreter driving
//! capability calls — the `.ragsh` REPL and the recursive-language-model
//! runtime that used to ship here) are deliberately *not* part of this crate:
//! they are host concerns, built on top of [`registry`] and [`harness`].
//!
//! ## Crate-root re-exports
//!
//! For discoverability the most-used types from each surface are re-exported at
//! the crate root, grouped below by surface ([`error`], [`registry`],
//! [`language`], [`harness`], and [`graph`]).
