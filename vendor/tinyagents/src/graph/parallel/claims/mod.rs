//! Shared-workspace claim arbitration for parallel agent fan-out.
//!
//! [`map_reduce`](super::map_reduce) answers "run these N items with bounded
//! concurrency". It cannot answer whether running them concurrently is *safe*.
//! When fanned-out workers share one filesystem root, two of them mutating the
//! same file at the same time corrupts it silently — there is no error, just a
//! plausible-looking result built on a torn tree.
//!
//! This module owns that decision, and only that decision. Given a set of
//! [`WorkspaceClaim`]s it returns a [`DispatchPlan`] saying which workers may
//! run concurrently, which must be serialized, and which cannot be scheduled at
//! all. It performs no I/O, spawns nothing, and never renders a message.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! A worker is safe to run in parallel when it either has its own root
//! (`isolated`) or never writes (`!writes`). A worker that writes a *shared*
//! root must declare the paths it owns; it is then serialized, and its claim is
//! checked against every claim already granted.
//!
//! Claims are granted in **input order, first-writer-wins**. That ordering is
//! load-bearing: it makes the plan a pure function of the input, independent of
//! how quickly any worker happens to finish, so the same request always yields
//! the same rejection.
//!
//! # What stays with the caller
//!
//! The crate reports a [`ClaimConflict`] as data; it never decides what a host
//! does about one. Whether an unbounded write is a hard rejection or a warning,
//! and what sentence the user reads, are product decisions. Likewise the syntax
//! a claim arrives in: [`parse_relative_claim_paths`] takes the *body* of a
//! claim list, not whatever prefix or key a host wraps it in.
