//! Settling orphaned tasks left behind by a dead executor.
//!
//! A detached task runs on an executor owned by the process that spawned it.
//! When that process dies, the executor, its abort handle and its cancellation
//! token die with it — but a durable [`TaskStore`] still holds a non-terminal
//! record. Nothing will ever complete that record, so without reconciliation it
//! reads as perpetually live: a supervisor waits forever, and a ledger renders a
//! run that has not existed since the last restart.
//!
//! [`reconcile_orphaned_tasks`] settles those records. It owns the state machine
//! — which statuses count as live, and which terminal state each becomes — and
//! nothing else. The failure *reason* is supplied by the caller, because the
//! sentence a user reads about their own product is not this crate's to write.
//!
//! Reconciliation is best-effort by construction: a record that races to
//! terminal between the listing and the transition is expected, not exceptional,
//! so per-task failures are captured in the report and the sweep continues.
