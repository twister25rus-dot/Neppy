//! Registry of in-flight autonomous runs, keyed by the session they stream into.
//!
//! Autonomous card runs are detached tasks, not turns a chat channel knows
//! about, so a "stop" arriving through the normal path has nothing to cancel.
//! Registering each run's [`AbortHandle`](tokio::task::AbortHandle) here gives
//! that path a handle to pull.
//!
//! The registry's real job is **deciding who cleans up**. A run that finishes
//! naturally and a cancel that arrives at the same moment both try to write the
//! card's terminal state. Both must go through [`ActiveRunRegistry::take`] (or
//! [`take_if`](ActiveRunRegistry::take_if)), and only one of them gets `Some` —
//! so the write-back happens exactly once.
