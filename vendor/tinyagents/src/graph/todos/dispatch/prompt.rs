//! Turning a task card into the prompt an autonomous run works from.
//!
//! Two pieces, both pure:
//!
//! - [`build_task_prompt`] — the goal prompt: the card's objective, plan, and
//!   acceptance criteria, plus provenance for a card ingested from an external
//!   source.
//! - [`build_progress_instruction`] — the addendum that tells the run how to
//!   keep its own card current while it works, and how to *stop* by blocking
//!   rather than guessing.
//!
//! The instruction text names two tools by convention — a memory-recall tool
//! and the board's own card-update tool. A host that registers them under
//! different names should pass its own names via [`TaskPromptTools`].
