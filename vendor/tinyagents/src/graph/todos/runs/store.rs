//! Persistence and lifecycle for [`TaskRun`]s, on the harness
//! [`Store`](crate::harness::store::Store).
//!
//! Each thread's runs are a single serialized `Vec<TaskRun>` under the
//! [`RUNS_NAMESPACE`] namespace, keyed by the hex-encoded thread id — the same
//! addressing the board itself uses in
//! [`graph::todos::store`](crate::graph::todos::store), so a board and its run
//! log live side by side in one store. Every mutation runs
//! `load → mutate → put` under a **per-thread async mutex**, so the
//! read-modify-write is atomic within the process (the same single-process
//! caveat as the board store).
//!
//! The run log is what makes a wedged worker recoverable: [`reclaim_stale`]
//! sweeps runs whose heartbeat or claim has aged out, closes them as
//! [`RunOutcome::Reclaimed`], and moves their card back to `Todo` — or parks it
//! at `Blocked` once the card has burned through
//! [`RunLimits::max_reclaim_count`] attempts, so a permanently poisonous card
//! stops cycling through workers.
