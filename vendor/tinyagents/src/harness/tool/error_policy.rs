//! Per-tool error handling policy.
//!
//! # The gap this closes
//!
//! [`Tool::call`][super::Tool::call] returns `Result<ToolResult>`, and an `Err`
//! propagates out of the agent loop and kills the run. The only way for a tool
//! to signal a *recoverable* failure — one the model should see and retry
//! differently — is to return `Ok(ToolResult::error(...))`. That convention is
//! documented, but it is a documentation-level contract only: nothing stops a
//! tool from returning `Err` for a routine "file not found", and when one does,
//! a whole agent run dies over something the model could have handled in one
//! more turn.
//!
//! LangChain solves this with `handle_tool_error: bool | str | Callable` on the
//! tool itself, resolved at execution time: a handled error flips the result's
//! status and comes back as a `ToolMessage(status="error")` rather than
//! propagating. [`ToolErrorPolicy`] is the same idea with the variants named.
//!
//! # The one rule that must not be broken
//!
//! **Cancellation and interruption always bubble.** See
//! [`ToolErrorPolicy::apply`].
