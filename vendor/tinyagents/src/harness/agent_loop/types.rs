//! Type definitions for the agent-loop module.
//!
//! The agent loop itself is implemented as inherent methods on
//! [`crate::harness::runtime::AgentHarness`] in the sibling `mod.rs`. The only
//! public type owned here is [`AgentLoopResult`], the richer return value that
//! pairs the accumulated [`AgentRun`] with a compact [`HarnessRunStatus`]
//! snapshot for callers that want lifecycle/status information alongside the
//! transcript.
//!
//! All public items are re-exported through [`super`].

/// [`crate::harness::runtime::AgentHarness::invoke`] returns `Err` on failure
/// and drops the [`AgentRun`] with it, so a run that tripped a limit or hit a
/// tool failure halfway through loses every message and usage figure it had
/// accumulated. `PartialRunOutcome` keeps both, letting a caller inspect,
/// repair, or resume from the partial conversation.
