//! End-to-end tool calling for a host that drives its own model loop.
//!
//! [`super`] answers *"what did the model ask for"*. This module answers
//! everything around it: how the model is **told** to ask, how results are
//! **rendered** back, and how a transcript is **replayed** onto the provider
//! wire so the next iteration is well-formed. Together those are one thing —
//! a **dialect** — and they have to move together, because a catalogue that
//! advertises one grammar and a parser that expects another is a silent
//! whole-turn failure with no error anywhere.
//!
//! Three dialects ship: [`XmlDialect`] (JSON in a tag), [`PFormatDialect`]
//! (compact positional), and [`NativeDialect`] (the provider's structured
//! channel).
//!
//! # Which surface to use
//!
//! There are two, and picking the wrong one costs a rewrite:
//!
//! * **Driving the crate's [`agent_loop`](crate::harness::agent_loop)** —
//!   use [`crate::harness::tool::prompt`]. It speaks
//!   [`Message`](crate::harness::message::Message) and slots straight into the
//!   loop, which owns the iteration for you.
//! * **Driving your own loop over your own durable transcript** — use this
//!   module. It speaks [`TranscriptEntry`], a deliberately thin record shape a
//!   host maps onto in a few `From` impls, and it does not assume anything
//!   about how or when you call the model.
//!
//! The second case is not a lesser one. A host with years of persisted
//! transcripts, per-turn security policy, and provider quirks encoded in its
//! own storage cannot adopt a foreign message model just to stop maintaining a
//! tool-call parser — and the parser is the part that is genuinely universal.
//! This module is the seam that lets it hand over the universal part alone.
//!
//! # What stays with the host
//!
//! Executing a tool: permission checks, sandboxing, approval gates, timeouts,
//! progress events. A dialect decides what the model *reads and writes*; it
//! never decides what is allowed to *happen*. That boundary is what keeps a
//! host's security policy in the host, where it can be audited.
