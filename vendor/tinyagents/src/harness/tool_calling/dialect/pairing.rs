//! Dropping half-finished tool cycles before a transcript reaches the wire.
//!
//! # The failure this exists to prevent
//!
//! Providers reject an assistant message carrying `tool_calls` unless it is
//! immediately followed by tool messages answering **every** `tool_call_id` on
//! it. The error is a hard `400`, not a degraded reply, and it fails the whole
//! request — so one orphaned record poisons every subsequent turn of that
//! thread until the history is edited.
//!
//! Bisected cycles are not exotic. A cached transcript restore, an aborted
//! turn, and history compaction can each preserve the assistant half while the
//! results half is dropped or was never persisted. The repair therefore belongs
//! at the last possible moment — here, while serializing — not at the write
//! sites, which are many and none of which can see the final sequence.
//!
//! # Why adjacency alone is not the check
//!
//! The provider's complaint is about *coverage*: a following tool message set
//! whose ids do not cover every id on the opener fails the same way as no
//! following messages at all. So the opener's id set must **equal** the
//! follower's, not merely be adjacent to a non-empty one.
//!
//! The drop is symmetric. A `ToolResults` record whose opener was dropped is
//! itself dropped, because a `tool` role message answering a call the model
//! never sees is just as malformed.
