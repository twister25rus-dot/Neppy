//! Rendering a tool catalogue into a system prompt.
//!
//! Two shapes, because there are two things a model can be told:
//!
//! * [`render_pformat_catalogue`] gives it a **call signature** —
//!   `read_file[path]` — which is all a positional dialect needs and costs a
//!   handful of tokens per tool.
//! * [`render_json_catalogue`] gives it the **whole parameter schema**, which
//!   is what a JSON-in-tag dialect needs because the model has to name each
//!   argument itself.
//!
//! Neither is the "informational" case: when the provider receives real tool
//! specs in the request, repeating them in the prompt is pure token bloat, so
//! the native dialect renders no catalogue at all.
