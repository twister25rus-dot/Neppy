//! The transcript vocabulary a [`ToolDialect`](super::ToolDialect) speaks.
//!
//! # Why this is not [`crate::harness::message::Message`]
//!
//! The harness's own message model is richer than what a dialect needs, and
//! richer than what most hosts persist. A host that has been storing agent
//! transcripts for years has a *durable* record shape — a role string, a
//! content string, some passthrough metadata — and the exact bytes it puts on
//! the provider wire are part of its contract with those providers. Lifting
//! that host's dialect logic into this crate through
//! [`Message`](crate::harness::message::Message) would mean a lossy round-trip
//! through a model built for a different purpose, and the loss would land
//! precisely on the fields providers reject requests over: `reasoning_content`,
//! per-call `extra_content`, the tool-call/tool-result pairing.
//!
//! So these types are deliberately thin. They are the *lowest common
//! denominator of a chat transcript* — enough to render a dialect, and no
//! opinion about anything else. A host maps its own records onto them in a
//! handful of `From` impls and gets byte-identical output back.
//!
//! For hosts driving the crate's own agent loop, the equivalent surface is
//! [`crate::harness::tool::prompt`], which speaks
//! [`Message`](crate::harness::message::Message) instead. The two are parallel
//! on purpose; see [the module docs](super) for which one to reach for.
