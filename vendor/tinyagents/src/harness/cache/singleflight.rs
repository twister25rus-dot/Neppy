//! Stampede protection: collapse concurrent identical cache misses into one
//! provider call.
//!
//! # The gap this fills
//!
//! A cache in front of a slow provider does nothing for the *first* N callers.
//! Ten sub-agents that ask the same sub-question at the same moment all miss,
//! all call the provider, and nine of those calls are pure waste — paid for,
//! rate-limit consuming, and then thrown away when the last writer wins.
//!
//! Neither reference implementation solves this: LangChain's own unit test
//! documents the race rather than preventing it. So this is greenfield, and
//! deliberately small — one in-flight map plus a `tokio::sync::broadcast`
//! channel per key.
//!
//! # Semantics
//!
//! The first caller for a key becomes the **leader** and runs the closure. Any
//! caller arriving while the leader is in flight becomes a **follower** and
//! waits for the leader's outcome instead of running the closure. Followers
//! receive a clone of the leader's success.
//!
//! Errors are **not** shared: a follower whose leader failed re-runs the
//! closure itself. Sharing the failure would turn one caller's transient 503
//! into every concurrent caller's failure while hiding the fact that each had
//! its own retry budget — and an error is not a value worth caching.
