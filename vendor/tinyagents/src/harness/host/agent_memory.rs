//! Host capability: durable agent memory.
//!
//! This is the largest of the host seams described in the host-capability
//! traits RFC (§3.1). A host that keeps long-lived knowledge about a user — a
//! memory store, a summary tree, a citation index — implements
//! [`AgentMemory`] and hands it to the runtime; a host with no such store
//! simply supplies nothing.
//!
//! **The capability is optional, and absence is expressed by the host passing
//! `None`, never by an implementation that returns an error.** An erroring stub
//! would teach the model that memory exists and make it retry a call that can
//! never succeed, so "this deployment has no memory" and "the memory backend is
//! down" must stay distinguishable: the first is `None` at wiring time, the
//! second is an `Err` from a real implementation.
//!
//! # What the runtime is *not* allowed to do
//!
//! The runtime must not learn what a memory is. Items returned by
//! [`AgentMemory::recall`] have **already** been scope-filtered and redacted by
//! the host, so the runtime injects them as it received them: no re-ranking, no
//! second filtering pass, no truncation-by-relevance of its own. Re-ranking
//! would silently reorder a host's access-control decision, and re-filtering
//! would let runtime heuristics drop text the host had deliberately kept.
//! Symmetrically, [`AgentMemory::remember`] carries no provenance, taint, or
//! trust field — stamping those is the host's job, and a runtime-supplied
//! provenance value would be self-attested and therefore worthless as a
//! security signal.
//!
//! # Value types
//!
//! Everything in this module is inert: `serde` + `std` only, no tokio, no
//! storage engine, no host schema type. A host must be able to build a mapper
//! against these structs without pulling in the runtime's machinery.
