//! Host capability: turn-context composition (RFC §3.2, **required**).
//!
//! The runtime knows the *mechanical* parts of a turn — which agent is running,
//! which thread it belongs to, and what the user just said. It deliberately does
//! not know the parts that make an assistant feel like a particular product:
//! identity/soul text, descriptions of whichever integrations the user has
//! actually connected, and whatever learned context the host has accumulated
//! about this person. Those are host material, they change per deployment, and
//! several of them are business rules that must never ship inside a
//! redistributed crate.
//!
//! [`ContextComposer`] is the seam. Before each turn the runtime hands the host
//! a [`TurnContextRequest`] and receives back the system prompt (and optionally
//! a few messages to prepend). The runtime treats both as **opaque** — it does
//! not parse, re-order, truncate, or otherwise interpret what comes back.
//!
//! Unlike the optional capabilities in this module family, a host must always
//! supply one: a turn with no system prompt at all is not a meaningful default,
//! so "absent" is not a state the runtime can act on. Hosts that genuinely have
//! nothing to inject use [`StaticContextComposer`] with a fixed prompt rather
//! than passing `None`.
//!
//! # Empty is not failure
//!
//! [`ContextComposer::preamble`] returning an empty `Vec` is the *normal* case,
//! not an error and not a signal that something is missing. Only hosts with
//! pinned context or explicit goals to inject return anything, and the runtime
//! must proceed unchanged when the vector is empty.
