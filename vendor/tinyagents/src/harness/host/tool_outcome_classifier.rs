//! Host seam for deciding what a tool result *means*.
//!
//! The runtime knows whether a tool call returned; it does not know whether
//! what came back should be treated as a success, retried, or given up on.
//! That judgement is product knowledge, and it is tool-specific: a `404` from a
//! CRM lookup usually means "no such record" — a perfectly good empty result —
//! while a `404` from a document fetch means the run cannot proceed. The same
//! transport-level shape lands in two different classes depending on which
//! integration produced it, so no rule the crate could hard-code would be right
//! for both. Hence a trait: the host, which owns the integration catalogue,
//! answers.
//!
//! This capability is **optional** (RFC §3.8). A host that has no per-tool
//! knowledge passes `None` and the runtime skips classification entirely,
//! rather than being handed a stub that always answers
//! [`OutcomeClass::Success`]. Absence and "classified as fine" are different
//! facts, and conflating them is exactly the failure mode RFC §2.3 forbids.
//! [`ErrorFieldClassifier`] exists for hosts that want the obvious baseline
//! *deliberately*, not as a silent default.
//!
//! **Reuses [`ToolResult`] on purpose.** There is no parallel
//! "classifiable result" type here. A second result struct would have to be
//! populated by the runtime from the real one, and every field added to
//! [`ToolResult`] would then either need mirroring or would be invisible to
//! classifiers — a drift surface with no upside. Classifiers read the real
//! result, including `raw`, which is where a host's structured error codes
//! live.
//!
//! **Dependency rule:** `serde` + `std` only, matching the inert-value-type
//! carve-out in [`crate::harness::config::types`]. A host can implement this
//! trait without pulling an engine.
