//! Host capability: choosing *which* model answers a turn.
//!
//! [`crate::harness::model::ChatModel`] already covers *how* a model is called.
//! What the runtime cannot supply is the decision of **which** model a given
//! turn should use. That decision is product policy — route the lead agent to a
//! frontier model and its subagents to a cheap one, send background/"thinking"
//! work to a lower tier, pin a particular role to a local model — and it is
//! exactly the kind of rule that differs per host and changes without notice.
//! Encoding any of it here would bake one product's economics into a
//! redistributed crate.
//!
//! So the seam is a question, not an answer: the runtime describes the turn it
//! is about to run ([`ModelResolveRequest`]) and the host hands back a model to
//! call. The runtime never inspects the reasoning, never learns which tier it
//! got, and never caches the decision — a host is free to answer differently
//! for two identical requests (A/B routing, failover after an outage, a quota
//! that just tripped).
//!
//! # When a host supplies this
//!
//! Always. Unlike the optional sinks, `ModelResolver` is a **required**
//! capability: a turn with no model cannot run at all, so there is no
//! meaningful "absent" state to distinguish from failure. A host with exactly
//! one model wires [`FixedModelResolver`] and is done; a host with routing
//! rules implements the trait over its own policy.
//!
//! # Naming hazard — read before "fixing" this
//!
//! The crate already has [`crate::harness::model::ModelRequest`], and it is a
//! **different thing**: that type is the provider call payload (messages,
//! tools, sampling parameters) handed to a model that has already been chosen.
//! The type here, [`ModelResolveRequest`], is the *routing question* asked
//! before any payload exists. The near-miss in names is unfortunate but the
//! two are not interchangeable, and renaming this one to `ModelRequest` would
//! collide outright. Keep the `Resolve` in the name.
