//! The marker vocabulary, and the pure string transforms over it.
//!
//! Four tokens make up the wire format between a host's ingress and its
//! provider dispatch:
//!
//! | Token | Written by | Read by |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `[IMAGE:<ref>]` | the user / renderer | provider dispatch |
//! | `[FILE:<ref>]` | the user / renderer | ingress, then dispatch |
//! | `[Image: <name> #att:<id>]` | ingress, replacing an image marker | dispatch, rehydrating |
//! | `[FILE-EXTRACTED:…]` / `[FILE-ATTACHED:…]` | [`payload`](super::payload) | the model |
//!
//! The placeholder is mixed-case on purpose: `[Image:` never collides with the
//! `[IMAGE:` parser, so a persisted placeholder cannot be mistaken for an
//! unresolved attachment and re-read.
//!
//! Everything here is a pure function over `&str`. Message-level helpers — "how
//! many markers are in the latest user turn" — belong to the host, because only
//! the host knows what its message type is.
