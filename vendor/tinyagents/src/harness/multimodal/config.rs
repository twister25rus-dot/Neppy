//! Crate-owned attachment limits.
//!
//! Follows the [`harness::config`](crate::harness::config) convention: the
//! crate defines the struct, the host maps its own schema into it. Nothing
//! here reads a file or an environment variable.
//!
//! ## Why the clamps live here
//!
//! [`ImageLimits::effective`] and [`FileLimits::effective`] clamp the
//! configured values into runtime bounds. That clamping is part of the
//! resolution contract, not host policy: a host that forgot to clamp would
//! hand an unbounded `max_image_size_mb` straight into an allocation. Hosts
//! still choose the *configured* values; the crate only refuses to act on
//! absurd ones.
//!
//! ## The one asymmetry worth knowing
//!
//! `max_files == 0` is a **hard-disable sentinel**, and it is checked before
//! the clamp rather than after. The clamp lifts `0` to `1`, so a caller that
//! only consulted [`FileLimits::effective`] would admit a single file marker
//! from a source that asked for none. [`FileLimits::files_disabled`] is the
//! check that must run first; [`resolve`](super::resolve) does exactly that.
