//! Type definitions for first-class sub-agents.
//!
//! A [`SubAgent`] wraps an [`AgentHarness`] so it can be invoked as a *child
//! run*: a fully independent agent loop that runs one level deeper in the
//! recursion tree than its caller. [`SubAgentTool`] adapts a sub-agent into a
//! [`Tool`] so a parent agent can call another agent the same way it calls any
//! other tool — the key agent-calling-agent compositional pattern.
//!
//! All public items are re-exported through [`super`] so callers import from
//! `crate::harness::subagent` directly. Implementations and tests live in the
//! sibling `mod.rs` and `test.rs`.
