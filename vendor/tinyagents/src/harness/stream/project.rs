//! Projection from the raw [`AgentEvent`] stream onto typed [`StreamChunk`]s.
//!
//! This is the missing half of the streaming surface. [`StreamMode`],
//! [`StreamChunk`] and [`StreamSink`] were fully defined and tested but used
//! nowhere else in the crate — callers got raw `AgentEvent`s and each
//! re-implemented delta reassembly and filtering. This module supplies the one
//! function that turns an event into the chunk a consumer actually asked for.
//!
//! # Shape (ported from LangGraph)
//!
//! LangGraph multiplexes several *stream modes* over one producer: the producer
//! filters by the requested mode set (`_loop.py`'s `stream_modes` check) and the
//! consumer shapes the result (`main.py`'s `stream()` fan-out). The same split
//! applies here:
//!
//! - **Producer-side filtering** — [`project_event_for_modes`] returns `None`
//!   for an event whose chunk is not in the requested mode set, so nothing is
//!   allocated or cloned for a mode nobody is listening to.
//! - **Consumer-side shaping** — [`project_event`] gives the full projection
//!   when the caller wants to route chunks itself.
//!
//! # One event, at most one chunk
//!
//! Each [`AgentEvent`] projects to **at most one** [`StreamChunk`], so a
//! consumer subscribed to several modes never receives the same event twice in
//! two shapes. The routing table:
//!
//! | Event | Chunk | Mode |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`AgentEvent::ModelDelta`] | [`StreamChunk::Message`] | [`StreamMode::Messages`] |
//! | [`AgentEvent::StateUpdate`] | [`StreamChunk::Updates`] | [`StreamMode::Updates`] |
//! | [`AgentEvent::ControlApplied`] with an interrupting control | [`StreamChunk::Interrupt`] | [`StreamMode::Interrupts`] |
//! | [`AgentEvent::StreamClosed`] | — (not projected) | — |
//! | everything else | [`StreamChunk::Debug`] | [`StreamMode::Debug`] |
//!
//! [`StreamMode::Values`] is deliberately **not** produced here: a full state
//! snapshot is graph state, which the event stream does not carry. The graph
//! runtime pushes [`StreamChunk::Values`] itself.
//!
//! [`StreamMode::Custom`] is likewise never produced — by definition it is the
//! caller's own extension channel.
