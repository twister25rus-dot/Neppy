//! Error-context helper for the session store's SQLite surface.
//!
//! The store and run ledger are dense with driver calls whose bare failures
//! (`no such table`, `database is locked`) say nothing about which operation
//! raised them. This trait attaches that operation context while funnelling
//! everything into [`TinyAgentsError::Storage`], so the crate keeps one error
//! type without every call site writing the same closure.
//!
//! It deliberately mirrors the shape of `anyhow::Context` — including the
//! `Option` impl for "row expected but absent" — because this module was
//! ported from a host that used `anyhow`, and matching the shape kept that
//! port mechanical and reviewable.
