//! Retention, pruning and search-index repair for the session database.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Until it did, the session database had **no delete path at all**: sessions,
//! messages, tool calls, run events and telemetry accumulated forever, and the
//! only `DELETE FROM` anywhere in the crate lived in the graph checkpointer. A
//! long-lived workspace therefore grew without bound, and its full-text index
//! grew with it.
//!
//! It also had no way to *repair* the search index. `record_message` and its
//! siblings used to insert the row and its FTS entry as two separate autocommit
//! statements, so a failure in between left a row that could never be found by
//! search — permanently, because nothing re-derived the index. Those pairs are
//! transactional now, but databases written before that change still carry the
//! gaps, which is what [`reindex_fts`] is for.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Every entry point takes an explicit bound (`older_than` / `keep_last`) and
//! returns the number of rows removed. Nothing here runs on a schedule or on
//! its own: retention is a policy decision, so the host chooses when and how
//! much. All of them run inside one transaction, so a partial prune is never
//! observable.
