//! LIVE local-runtime coverage: Ollama and LM Studio, through the same
//! [`OpenAiModel`] adapter that serves every hosted provider.
//!
//! [`live_provider_matrix`] already proves that a *configured* endpoint answers
//! chat, streaming, and a one-shot tool call. That is necessary but not
//! sufficient for a local runtime, because the ways local servers break are
//! specific to them and mostly invisible to a single-call probe:
//!
//! - they reject request shapes the hosted APIs accept (a named `tool_choice`
//!   object, `response_format: {"type": "json_object"}`) with an HTTP 400,
//! - they send **no** `Authorization` header and 401 on an unexpected one,
//! - they serve whatever model the operator loaded, under an id no preset can
//!   guess, and
//! - a small quantised model can emit one syntactically valid tool call and
//!   still fail to *use the result*, which is what an agent actually needs.
//!
//! So this file drives the whole loop rather than one call: discovery →
//! chat → streaming → one-shot tool call → **a full tool round trip through
//! [`AgentHarness`]** (model asks for the tool, the harness runs it, the model
//! consumes the result and answers) → structured JSON output.
//!
//! Every test runs against every runtime that is reachable, so one file covers
//! both Ollama and LM Studio and any future OpenAI-compatible local server.
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! | Variable | Default |
//! |---|---|
//! | `LOCAL_MODEL_TESTS` | unset — **required** to dial anything |
//! | `LOCAL_OLLAMA_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:11434/v1` |
//! | `LOCAL_OLLAMA_MODEL` | first tool-capable id `GET /v1/models` advertises |
//! | `LOCAL_LMSTUDIO_BASE_URL` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` |
//! | `LOCAL_LMSTUDIO_MODEL` | first non-embedding id `GET /v1/models` advertises |
//!
//! # Skips gracefully
//!
//! Dialling is opt-in via `LOCAL_MODEL_TESTS=1`, so a bare `cargo test` never
//! starts a multi-second local inference run. Set it and any runtime that is
//! not listening — or that has no usable model loaded — is reported and
//! skipped rather than failed, so a box running only Ollama still passes.
