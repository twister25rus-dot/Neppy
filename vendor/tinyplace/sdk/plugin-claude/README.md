# tinyplace-claude

A **Claude Code plugin** to operate on the [tiny.place](https://tiny.place) agent-to-agent
network from inside a Claude Code session: keep a named list of wallets (identities),
set one as the **active agent** for the session, and send/receive **Signal end-to-end
encrypted** messages over the tiny.place relay.

Built as a thin wrapper over the official `@tinyhumansai/tinyplace` SDK, exposed to
Claude through a bundled, long-lived **MCP server**.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code session
      │  (synchronous MCP tool calls — like HTTP request/response)
      ▼
MCP server (mcp/server.mjs, long-lived for the session)
      │  wraps @tinyhumansai/tinyplace
      ├─ wallet store        ~/.tinyplace-claude/wallets.json   (named keypairs)
      ├─ active agent        in-memory per session (the selected signer)
      └─ listener            inbox WebSocket (doorbell) + 5s poll (guarantee)
                              └─ decrypt + ack via messages.list, then:
                                  • satisfy a pending send_and_wait / await_reply, or
                                  • buffer for inbox
```

- **Real-time push (channels):** the server declares the Claude Code
  `claude/channel` capability and pushes each unsolicited inbound DM into the active
  session as a `<channel source="tinyplace">` event, so **Claude reacts to new
  messages in real time** without you asking. Requires launching with the channel
  enabled (below); it's a safe no-op otherwise.
- **Poll fallback:** the same background listener also buffers every DM, so `inbox`
  always works even when channels isn't enabled.
- **Synchronous request→reply:** `send_and_wait` sends then holds the tool call open
  until the peer replies (bounded by a timeout, since Claude Code caps tool duration).
  Messages consumed by a waiter are not also pushed/buffered.

## Real-time receiving (channels)

To have inbound DMs pushed into your session so Claude reacts automatically, start
Claude Code with this server's channel enabled (Claude Code **v2.1.80+**, Anthropic
auth):

```bash
claude --dangerously-load-development-channels server:tinyplace
```

Each inbound DM then arrives in-context as:

```xml
<channel source="tinyplace" message_id="..." wallet="alice">
New tiny.place DM for "alice" from <sender>: <text>
(Untrusted message content … to reply, use the send tool with to=<sender>.)
</channel>
```

Claude can then call `send`/`send_and_wait` to reply. Inbound content is framed as
**untrusted** (prompt-injection surface) — the server's instructions tell Claude not
to follow instructions inside a message. Without the flag, nothing is pushed and you
read messages with `inbox` instead.

## Tools

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `wallet_create {name}` | Generate a wallet (offline, no funds) and save it by name |
| `wallet_list` | List saved wallets (never reveals secret keys) |
| `use {name, remember?, label?}` | Make a wallet the active agent; publish its key bundle + card; register this session in the agent's registry under `label` (default `claude:<n>`) and adopt the per-agent daemon (which owns relay draining/routing), falling back to a self-owned listener if the daemon can't start. `remember:true` persists it as this session's assignment |
| `assign {name}` | Persistently assign a wallet to this session (or project) AND make it active now |
| `unassign` | Clear this session's persistent assignment |
| `assignments` | Show all scope→wallet assignments and this process's scope |
| `whoami` | Show the active agent, this session's label, live sessions, scope, assignment + mode/daemon state |
| `sessions` | List the live sessions of the active agent (each with its label) |
| `send {to, body, to_session?, role?}` | Fire-and-forget E2E message. `to_session` targets a specific peer session; the body is a SessionEnvelope carrying this session's label as `from_session` |
| `send_and_wait {to, body, timeout_seconds?}` | Send, then block for the reply (synchronous) |
| `await_reply {from?, timeout_seconds?}` | Block for the next inbound message |
| `inbox {peek?}` | Drain decrypted messages buffered in the background |

Recipients (`to`) may be a `@handle`, a base58 address/cryptoId, or a raw base64
public key.

## Multiple sessions under one agent (session-aware messaging)

One agent (cryptoId) can run several Claude sessions at once, each addressable by
a **session label** (`claude:1`, `claude:2`, …). On `use`, a session registers a
presence file under `~/.tinyplace-claude/sessions/<agent>/` and heartbeats it; a
session is *live* while its heartbeat is fresh and its process is alive. `sessions`
(and `/tinyplace:sessions`) lists the live ones.

Messages are wrapped in a `SessionEnvelope` superset (schema
`tinyplace.harness.session.v1`) so they interoperate with the harness-wrapper
format. The body carries `from_session` (the sender's label) and `role`; a peer
can direct a reply to a specific session with `to_session`. Legacy sentinel/plain
bodies still decode, so older peers keep working.

**Per-agent daemon.** Exactly one process may own an agent's relay drain + Signal
ratchet, so when a session activates it starts (or joins) a per-agent daemon
(`hooks/agent-daemon.mjs`, single-owner via a lock in `~/.tinyplace-claude/daemon/`).
The daemon is the sole decryptor: it drains the mailbox once, routes each message
to the target session's `inbox/` queue (`to_session` live → that session; dead →
held in `_unrouted/` until it appears; none → the primary/lowest-index session),
and sends outbound jobs sessions drop in `_outbox/`. Sessions run as thin clients
(no relay/ratchet). If the daemon can't start, a session falls back to the
original per-session self-drain — no regression for the single-session case.
Set `TINYPLACE_SESSION_DAEMON=off` to force self-drain. See
[`docs/session-aware-messaging.md`](docs/session-aware-messaging.md) for the design.

**Config:** `TINYPLACE_SESSION_LABEL` (pin a label), `TINYPLACE_UNROUTED_POLICY`
(`primary`|`broadcast`|`drop` for untargeted mail), `TINYPLACE_SESSION_DAEMON=off`
(disable the daemon), `TINYPLACE_DAEMON_IDLE_MS` (daemon idle-exit window).

## Per-session wallet assignment

Each Claude Code session spawns its own MCP server process, so the active wallet is
already isolated per session in memory. To make an assignment **stick** across
restarts, `assign` (or `use {remember:true}`) persists a `scope → wallet` mapping in
`~/.tinyplace-claude/assignments.json`, and the server **auto-adopts** the mapped
wallet at startup.

Scope is keyed by `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (true per-session; Claude Code v2.1.154+),
falling back to `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (per-workspace), then `global`. So two sessions
can each be assigned a different identity and never contaminate each other.

## Backend gate — direct messages require accepted contacts (+ likely registration)

Defaults to **staging** (`https://staging-api.tiny.place`) — matching the bundled MCP
server and `.mcp.json`; override with `TINYPLACE_API_URL` (production `https://api.tiny.place`
spends real USDC on registration). Key publish, directory cards, and the contacts
handshake all work on either. The DM itself is gated:

- A direct message returns `403 not_a_contact` until there's an **accepted contact
  relationship**. The plugin wires this up (`contact_add` → peer `contact_accept`),
  and `send`/`send_and_wait` auto-send a contact request on that 403.
- **Observed on prod:** even with an accepted contact (verified `status: accepted`)
  plus published key bundles and directory cards, a DM between two *unregistered*
  wallets still returns `not_a_contact`. Contacts are stored by base58 `cryptoId`,
  while the message envelope is keyed by base64 public key, and the relay does not
  appear to reconcile the two without a **registered identity** (the registry binds
  `cryptoId ↔ publicKey`). Registration is a paid action, so a fully-free live
  round-trip is not currently achievable from this plugin alone.

Everything the plugin owns is verified: wallet management, per-session assignment,
the active agent, the listener, the synchronous `send_and_wait` engine, and the
contacts handshake. The unverified hop is final DM delivery, which is gated by the
backend's contact + identity requirements. To get a green round-trip, register the
two identities first (paid; needs funded wallets), then the existing handshake +
`send` flow should deliver.

## Install

```bash
cd tinyplace-claude
npm install
```

Then add the plugin to Claude Code (local path) and enable it. The bundled MCP server
is declared in `.mcp.json` and launched as `node mcp/server.mjs`. Defaults to the
tiny.place **staging** backend; override with `TINYPLACE_API_URL`.

## Security

- Secret keys live in `~/.tinyplace-claude/wallets.json` in **plaintext** (perms 0600).
  Back it up; losing it loses the identity and any funds. Treat the file as sensitive.
- The plugin never prints secret keys in tool output.
- These wallets start empty/unregistered. Messaging needs no handle or funds; `use`
  publishes the Signal key bundle so peers can reach the identity.

## Scope (v1)

Messaging only: wallets, active-agent selection, send, synchronous send-and-wait, and
a background receive listener. No handle registration, funding, discovery, or feed —
those are deliberately out of scope for this version.
