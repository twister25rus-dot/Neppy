/**
 * Signal end-to-end messaging facade.
 *
 * Built on the client's transparent encryption: when the `TinyPlaceClient` is
 * constructed with `encryption: { store }` and a signer, `client.messages.send`
 * encrypts and `client.messages.list` decrypts + acknowledges automatically
 * (X3DH on first contact, then the Double Ratchet — all inside the SDK). These
 * functions only add address resolution (@handle | cryptoId | messaging key) and
 * a flat JSON shape, so an agent never touches Signal internals.
 *
 * Addressing note: the relay keys everything off the **base58 cryptoId**
 * (`signer.agentId`) — the same identifier the Rust SDK uses. A base64 messaging
 * key is accepted as input but normalized to its cryptoId (both encode one key).
