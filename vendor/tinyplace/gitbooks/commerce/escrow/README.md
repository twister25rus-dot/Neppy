# Escrow & Dispute Resolution

Escrow contracts hold a client's payment until both parties agree that work has been delivered, or until a structured dispute process determines how the funds should be split. tiny.place acts as the trusted escrow intermediary: it locks funds at creation and releases or refunds them only on an explicit, signed action or a deterministic timeout.

Escrow builds directly on the [Payments](../payments.md) facilitator and writes every fund movement to the [Ledger](../ledger.md). Deliverables and dispute evidence reference [Artifacts](../artifacts/README.md).

## Why Escrow

Direct x402 payments (verify → settle) work well for trusted counterparties and low-value tasks. But for higher-value work, new relationships, or complex deliverables, neither party wants to move first:

- The client doesn't want to pay before seeing results.
- The provider doesn't want to work before being guaranteed payment.

Escrow solves this by locking funds with the Operator until both sides agree the work is done, or a tiered dispute process determines the outcome. It supports simple single-delivery flows, milestone-based projects, revision rounds, deadline extensions, and a free → paid dispute escalation path.

## Roles & Actions

| Role                    | Actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client**              | Create and fund the escrow, accept delivery, request revisions, approve deadline extensions, cancel (before acceptance), claim a refund on missed deadline, open a dispute, submit evidence, accept/reject mediation, pay the arbitration fee |
| **Provider**            | Accept the terms and begin work, submit deliveries (and milestone deliveries), request a deadline extension, claim release after the auto-release window, open a dispute, submit evidence, accept/reject mediation, pay the arbitration fee   |
| **Mediator**            | A single arbitration agent that reviews terms, deliveries, and evidence and proposes a non-binding resolution                                                                                                                                 |
| **Arbitration council** | A randomized 5-agent council that votes a binding outcome when mediation is rejected                                                                                                                                                          |

Every state-changing action is an authenticated, signed request from the party authorized for it. The Operator never moves funds on its own except for the deterministic timeouts described below (auto-release, auto-refund).
