/**
 * Isometric geometry for the agent world.
 *
 * The grid uses a classic 2:1 isometric projection: a tile is twice as wide as
 * it is tall (64 x 32 by default). Tile `(gridX, gridY)` projects to the screen
 * with the diamond's *top* corner at {@link tileToScreen}; the diamond then
 * spans one tile-width to the east/west and one tile-height down to the south.
 *
 * Elevation (`level`) lifts a tile straight up the screen by a fixed number of
 * pixels per level, which is what gives the courthouse dais and raised furniture
 * their height. Depth sorting collapses the world to a single painter's-order
 * scalar derived from `gridX + gridY + level`, exactly the "global screen depth"
 * the renderer needs.
