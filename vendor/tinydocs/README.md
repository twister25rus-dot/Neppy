# TinyDocs

Agent-friendly document synthesis and text extraction in Rust: writes `.docx`
and `.pptx`, reads `.pdf`.

`tinydocs` turns a typed, validated document spec into real office-format
bytes. It is built for hosts that let a language model produce documents: the
spec types double as the JSON tool schema, validation rejects a malformed spec
with a structured error naming the exact offending field so the model can
self-correct, and synthesis hands back a plain byte buffer.

```rust
use tinydocs::docx::{self, DocumentSection, DocumentSpec};

let spec = DocumentSpec {
    title: "Weekly Report".to_string(),
    author: Some("Ferris".to_string()),
    sections: vec![DocumentSection {
        heading: Some("Highlights".to_string()),
        paragraphs: vec!["Throughput doubled.".to_string()],
        bullets: vec!["Shipped the parser".to_string()],
    }],
};

let bytes = docx::generate(&spec)?;
std::fs::write("report.docx", bytes)?;
# Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
```

## What it does not do

No filesystem access, no subprocesses, no async runtime, no deadline handling.
`docx::generate` is synchronous and CPU-bound.

That is a deliberate seam, not an omission. A host running on an async executor
owns the blocking-pool hop and the timeout, because only the host knows its own
executor and deadline policy — a crate that guessed at either would be wrong
for every host that guessed differently. The typical async caller looks like:

```rust,ignore
let spec = spec.clone();
let bytes = tokio::time::timeout(
    deadline,
    tokio::task::spawn_blocking(move || tinydocs::docx::generate(&spec)),
)
.await???;
```

## Validation

Every limit is a public constant, so a host can quote the exact number in its
own tool description and stay in lockstep with what validation enforces.

Each format's limits live in its own module, because the same name means a
different thing in each — `spec::document::MAX_TEXT_CHARS` bounds a heading,
`spec::presentation::MAX_TEXT_CHARS` bounds a bullet.

`spec::document` (`.docx`):

| Limit | Value | Bounds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAX_SECTIONS` | 128 | sections per document |
| `MAX_TEXT_CHARS` | 2,000 | title, author, section heading |
| `MAX_PARAGRAPH_CHARS` | 20,000 | one paragraph or bullet |
| `MAX_PARAGRAPHS_PER_SECTION` | 200 | paragraphs per section |
| `MAX_BULLETS_PER_SECTION` | 200 | bullets per section |
| `MAX_TOTAL_CHARS` | 2,000,000 | all text in the document |

`spec::presentation` (`.pptx`):

| Limit | Value | Bounds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MAX_SLIDES` | 64 | content slides per deck |
| `MAX_TEXT_CHARS` | 2,000 | any single text field |
| `MAX_BULLETS_PER_SLIDE` | 32 | bullets per slide |
| `MAX_IMAGES_PER_SLIDE` | 6 | images per slide |
| `MAX_IMAGES_PER_DECK` | 8 | images across the deck |
| `MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` | 5 MiB | one embedded image |

The aggregate cap is the load-bearing one. The per-field limits bound each
individual piece but not their product — `MAX_SECTIONS ×
MAX_PARAGRAPHS_PER_SECTION × MAX_PARAGRAPH_CHARS` alone is over 500M
characters, so a spec satisfying every other limit could still build a
multi-hundred-megabyte document in memory.

`DocumentSpec::validate` and `PresentationSpec::validate` are public and run
before any synthesis, so a host can reject a bad tool call at its own boundary
without paying for a blocking hop.

A presentation carries its images as bytes, not as paths or identifiers:
resolving indirection is host policy — which directories an agent may read,
whether an identifier belongs to the caller — and this crate has no business
holding it. `SlideImage::from_bytes` does the mechanical half, identifying the
format and reading the dimensions, and needs no writer to do it.

## The spec is separable from the codec

Every spec type, every limit, and every `validate` lives in `tinydocs::spec`,
which depends on nothing but `serde` and the crate's own error type. It is
compiled in **every** build, including `--no-default-features`, so:

```toml
tinydocs = { version = "0.1", default-features = false }
```

gives a host the authoritative wire contract and its validation without pulling
in a single format writer. That is what a host does when synthesis happens
somewhere else — in another process, or behind the TinyBus module below — and it
is why such a host does not have to re-declare the spec and let it drift.

The format modules re-export what they consume, so `tinydocs::docx::DocumentSpec`
and `tinydocs::spec::DocumentSpec` name the same type and existing code keeps
compiling.

## TinyBus module

`tinydocs-bus` is the dependency-light contract crate for TinyBus hosts. It
contains the bus identity, member names, versioning, and `DocumentSpec` types,
but no TinyBus transport or document writer. `tinydocs` re-exports the same
types, so existing `tinydocs::docx` callers remain source-compatible.

The private `tinydocs-module` workspace crate builds TinyDocs as a trusted
in-process TinyBus module:

```sh
cargo build --release --package tinydocs-module
```

The native artifact is `target/release/libtinydocs_module.so` on Linux,
`libtinydocs_module.dylib` on macOS, or `tinydocs_module.dll` on Windows. Load
it with a TinyBus host built with its `modules` feature. It claims
`ai.tinyhumans.tinydocs.Documents` at `/ai/tinyhumans/tinydocs/Documents` and
exposes:

```text
GenerateDocx(DocumentSpec)                         -> OutputRef
GeneratePptx(deck, Option<StreamRef>)              -> OutputRef
ExtractText(StreamRef)                             -> OutputRef
ReadOutput(output_id, offset, len)                 -> base64
ReleaseOutput(output_id)                           -> ()
```

Payloads in and payloads out are not symmetric, and the reason is worth knowing.

**Inbound bytes ride a TinyBus stream.** The caller opens one alongside the call
and writes while the call is outstanding; flow control, the size cap, the idle
timeout and the "only the peer that opened it may write" rule are all the bus's,
so nothing here re-implements them. A deck's images are concatenated into a
single stream in slide order, each declaring its `byte_len`, because a call has
one stream and a deck has many pictures — and putting the lengths in the spec is
what makes a truncated transfer a named rejection instead of a deck with a
picture assembled from two different images.

**Replies cannot.** `Interface::call` receives a member name and a JSON body —
no caller identity, no connection — so a served object cannot open a stream back
to whoever called it. A produced document is therefore held by the module and
pulled with `ReadOutput`, because returning it inline would put it through a
16 MiB JSON frame where a `Vec<u8>` costs about 3.5 bytes per byte. That half
disappears the day TinyBus grows a reply-stream seam.

What the module holds is bounded four ways — per document, in total, by count,
and by an idle TTL — because TinyBus never unloads a module, so anything retained
is retained until the process exits unless something reclaims it.

This interface replaces `ai.tinyhumans.tinydocs.Docx`, which returned bytes
inline. TinyBus's guidance is that an existing interface must not change in
place, so the new contract took a new name.

A TinyBus host can download and verify the matching archive directly from a
tagged GitHub release with `ModuleHost::load_github_release`; the archive must
be selected by its exact target-specific asset name and the release URL must
point to the tag, not a moving branch.

Run the real loader test locally after building the release artifact:

```sh
TINYDOCS_TEST_MODULE="$PWD/target/release/libtinydocs_module.so" \
  cargo test --package tinydocs-module --test module_e2e -- --ignored
```

## Feature flags

Each format is a separate gate, and every gate is on by default. Turning one off
drops its writer and that writer's dependencies; `tinydocs::spec` stays either
way, so the contract and its validation survive any combination.

| Feature | Default | Gates | Also drops |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `docx` | on | `.docx` synthesis via `docx-rs` | `quick-xml` |
| `pptx` | on | `.pptx` synthesis via `ppt-rs` | `syntect`, `pulldown-cmark`, `xml-rs` |
| `pdf` | on | `.pdf` text extraction via `pdf-extract` | `lopdf`, CFF/Type1/CMap parsers |

## Development

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive

cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-features
cargo run --example basic
.github/scripts/check-file-coverage.sh 90 coverage.json
```

Run the gated build too — it is the only thing that catches a feature that
compiles only when it is turned on:

```sh
cargo clippy --all-targets --no-default-features -- -D warnings
```
