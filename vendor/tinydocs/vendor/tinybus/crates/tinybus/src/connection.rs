//! A peer's link to the broker: outgoing calls, incoming dispatch, signals.
//!
//! One [`Connection`] serves both roles a peer can have. The kernel uses the
//! client half ([`Connection::call`], [`Connection::add_match`]); an
//! integration additionally uses the service half ([`Connection::serve_at`],
//! [`Connection::emit`]). They are not separate types because a service that
//! calls another service is normal — the transcription service asking the
//! notification service to say it is done should not need a second socket.
//!
//! # The dispatch loop
//!
//! Exactly one task reads the transport. It never awaits user code inline: a
//! method call is handed to a spawned task, so a slow `Transcribe` cannot stop
//! the connection from noticing that a reply to an earlier call has arrived.
//! That is the whole reason calls carry serials rather than relying on order.
//!
//! # Timeouts
//!
//! Every call has a deadline, defaulting to [`DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`]. This is not
//! optional and cannot be disabled, because the failure it prevents is the one
//! that motivated the project: an integration wedged inside a third-party
//! library used to wedge the kernel with it. A timeout does *not* cancel the
//! remote work — tinybus cannot — it stops waiting and frees the caller.
