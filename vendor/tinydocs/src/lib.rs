//! Agent-friendly document synthesis and text extraction in Rust.
//!
//! `tinydocs` turns a typed, validated document spec into real office-format
//! bytes. It is built for hosts that let a language model produce documents:
//! the spec types are the JSON tool schema, validation rejects a malformed
//! spec with a structured [`Error::InvalidInput`] naming the exact field so
//! the model can self-correct, and synthesis returns a plain byte buffer.
//!
//! # What this crate deliberately does not do
//!
//! No filesystem access, no subprocesses, no async runtime, no deadline
#![cfg_attr(
    feature = "docx",
    doc = "handling. [`docx::generate`] is synchronous and CPU-bound. A host that runs"
)]
#![cfg_attr(
    not(feature = "docx"),
    doc = "handling. `docx::generate` (this build has the `docx` feature disabled) is synchronous and CPU-bound. A host that runs"
)]
//! on an async executor owns the blocking-pool hop and the timeout, because
//! only the host knows its own executor and deadline policy — and a crate that
//! guessed at either would be wrong for every other host.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! - [`error`](self::Error) — the crate-wide [`Error`] and [`Result`].
//! - [`spec`] — the typed document specs and their validation. Compiled in
//!   every build, including `--no-default-features`, so a host whose synthesis
//!   happens elsewhere still shares one definition of the wire contract.
//! - [`Error`] and [`Result`] — the shared document and bus error contract.

//!     title: "Weekly Report".to_string(),

//!         heading: Some("Highlights".to_string()),
//!         paragraphs: vec!["Throughput doubled.".to_string()],
//!         bullets: vec!["Shipped the parser".to_string()],
//!     }],
//! };
//!
//! let bytes = docx::generate(&spec)?;
//! std::fs::write("report.docx", bytes)?;
//! # std::fs::remove_file("report.docx")?;
//! # Ok::<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>>(())
//! ```
//!
//! # Feature flags
//!
//! Each format is a separate gate, and every gate is on by default. Turning one
//! off drops its writer and that writer's dependencies; the specs stay, so the
//! contract and its validation survive any combination.
//!
//! - `docx` (default) — `.docx` synthesis via `docx-rs`.
//! - `pptx` (default) — `.pptx` synthesis via `ppt-rs`, which also drops
//!   `syntect` and `pulldown-cmark`.
//! - `pdf` (default) — `.pdf` text extraction via `pdf-extract`, which also
//!   drops its font and `PostScript` parsing stack.
