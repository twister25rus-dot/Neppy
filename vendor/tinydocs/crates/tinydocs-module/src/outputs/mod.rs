//! Holding a produced document until the caller has read it.
//!
//! # Why this exists at all
//!
//! Inbound payloads do not need it: `TinyBus` streams carry a `.pdf` or a slide
//! image alongside the method call, flow-controlled and bounded by the receiver's
//! own [`StreamLimits`](tinybus::stream::StreamLimits), and the transfer is tied
//! to the call that started it.
//!
//! Replies have no such thing. `Interface::call` receives a member name and a
//! JSON body — no caller identity, no connection — so a served object cannot open
//! a stream back to whoever called it. A generated `.docx` is therefore held here
//! and pulled in chunks, because the alternative is returning it inline through a
//! 16 MiB JSON frame where a `Vec<u8>` costs ~3.5 bytes per byte.
//!
//! That asymmetry is worth fixing upstream rather than working around forever: a
//! reply-stream seam in `TinyBus` would delete this module.
//!
//! # The bounds are the whole design
//!
//! A module is trusted in-process code that `TinyBus` never unloads, so anything
//! retained here is retained until the process exits unless something reclaims
//! it. A caller that asks for a document and then dies must not cost the host
//! that document forever. Hence a per-output cap, a total cap, a count cap, and
//! expiry of outputs nobody has read.
//!
//! Expiry is lazy — every operation sweeps first — so there is no background task
//! and no timer to reason about, and the clock is a parameter rather than a call
//! to [`Instant::now`], which is what makes the rules testable.
