//! The presentation spec as it crosses a bus, where bytes cannot travel inline.
//!
//! A `TinyBus` frame is a 16 MiB JSON document and a deck may legally carry
//! 40 MiB of images, so image bytes ride a stream beside the call rather than
//! inside it. A call has one stream and a deck has many images, so the images
//! are concatenated in slide order and each one declares its `byte_len`; the
//! module splits them apart and resolves each into a real
//! [`super::SlideImage`] — bytes, format and dimensions.
//!
//! The lengths live in the spec rather than in the stream because they are what
//! makes a truncated or over-long transfer a named rejection instead of a deck
//! with a picture assembled from two different images.
//!
//! Only the presentation spec needs this treatment. A document spec is text and
//! its aggregate cap keeps it inside a frame, so a document crosses unchanged.
//!
//! Defined here rather than in the module that serves it so a host driving that
//! module over a bus shares one definition of the shape instead of re-declaring
//! it. Like the rest of [`crate::spec`] it is serde and nothing else.
