# Roadmap

Replace this file with the real plan for the crate generated from this
template, or delete it if the project does not need a public roadmap.

Keep it short and honest: what exists, what is next, and what is deliberately
out of scope. A roadmap that lists everything is a roadmap nobody trusts.

## Shipped

- module layout, crate-wide error type, and the public re-export surface
- lint configuration in `[lints]`, enforced identically locally and in CI
- CI: format, clippy, build, test, rustdoc, MSRV, and supply-chain checks
- a manual release workflow that versions, tags, and publishes to crates.io
- a TinyBus-loadable native module exposing DOCX generation
- installable Linux and macOS bundles with the TinyBus host, module allowlist,
  source packages, and protocol documentation on GitHub releases
- end-to-end coverage through TinyBus's real dynamic loader and broker

## Next

- path or file-descriptor transfer for document formats that outgrow the bus
  frame limit
- additional document formats behind focused feature flags

## Out Of Scope

- anything that cannot be tested deterministically
- convenience wrappers that hide the crate's error taxonomy from callers
