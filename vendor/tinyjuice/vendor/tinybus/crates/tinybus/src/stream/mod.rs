//! Bulk payloads: chunked, flow-controlled byte streams between two peers.
//!
//! A frame is capped at [`MAX_FRAME_LEN`](crate::message::codec::MAX_FRAME_LEN)
//! and that cap is not negotiable — it is what stops a peer announcing a
//! gigabyte and making the reader allocate it. A stream is how a payload larger
//! than one frame crosses the bus anyway: the sender opens a stream on the
//! receiver, writes it as a sequence of bounded chunks, and closes it. What
//! travels in the method call is a [`StreamRef`] — a handle a few dozen bytes
//! long — and the bytes travel beside it.
//!
//! # Why this is a peer-to-peer interface and not a broker feature
//!
//! Every chunk is an ordinary method call addressed to the receiving peer. The
//! broker reads the header, routes it, and forwards it, exactly as it does for
//! everything else; it never sees a stream as anything other than traffic. A
//! broker that assembled streams would be a broker that buffers every payload
//! on the bus — which is both the memory problem and the "the broker has seen
//! every credential" problem, at once.
//!
//! # Flow control
//!
//! `Write` is a call, so it has a reply and a deadline. The receiver does not
//! reply until the chunk has room in the reader's window
//! ([`StreamLimits::window_chunks`]), so a sender runs exactly as fast as the
//! receiver drains and no faster. There is no unbounded buffer anywhere: a
//! receiver that never reads stalls the sender, the stall shows up as no
//! activity on the stream, and the idle reaper aborts it. That is the
//! misbehaving-peer invariant applied to bulk transfer — one peer's refusal to
//! read costs it its own stream and nobody else's memory.
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! Chunks carry a sequence number and the receiver requires the next one
//! exactly. The transport is already ordered, so this catches a pipelining
//! sender rather than a reordering network: two chunks in flight at once would
//! be dispatched into two tasks on the receiver and could land either way
//! round, and silently transposing two megabytes of a PDF is worse than an
//! error.
//!
//! # Base64
//!
//! Bodies are JSON, so a chunk is base64 and costs a third of its size in
//! overhead. That is the price of the payload travelling on the same wire as
//! everything else, and it is why `ROADMAP.md` still wants `SCM_RIGHTS`: an
//! fd-passing fast path can slot in under this same API later, because callers
//! hold a [`StreamRef`], not a byte array.
