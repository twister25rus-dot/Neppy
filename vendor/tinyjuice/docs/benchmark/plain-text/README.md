# Plain Text

Real OpenHuman Markdown/prose. With deterministic ML text compression disabled, TinyJuice passes plain text through unchanged.

Each row links to the full raw input and both compacted outputs. Percentages are **token reduction: higher is better**; 0% means pass-through. `Bytes` shows the raw input size -> compressor-only output size and its byte reduction. `Pass 1` disables CCR and is **lossless by construction**: faithful reshapes (JSON tables/minify, HTML->text) still ship because nothing is lost, but anything that *drops* detail (log lines, diff context, search matches, code bodies, sampled JSON rows) passes the original through untouched, since without the cache it could not be recovered. `Pass 2` enables CCR, so information-dropping compression is allowed — every dropped block is offloaded behind a retrieval token. Faithful reshapes (HTML->text) are identical in both passes (Pass 2 is marginally lower only for the recovery footer); pure information-dropping categories (diffs, search, code) are 0% in Pass 1 and compress only in Pass 2. Two categories are hybrids that compress losslessly in Pass 1 and further in Pass 2: JSON renders the full lossless markdown table in Pass 1 (all rows) then samples the middle away in Pass 2; logs collapse runs of byte-identical lines to `line [x N]` in Pass 1 then drop low-signal lines in Pass 2. Each pass links its own output and its own diff against the input.

## Cases

Every case links to the raw input; each pass column carries its percentage plus that pass's exact output and a unified diff against the input.

## What TinyJuice Is Doing

Plain text is the control group. With ML text compression off, the router declines compression and returns the original unchanged whenever deterministic structure is not available.

# Memory Keeper

## Purpose

Scan the current conversation context and update `.claude/memory.md` with anything important that was learned, fixed, discovered, or decided during this session. This file serves as institutional knowledge for anyone sta...

## What to capture

- **Fixes and workarounds** — what broke and how it was fixed (e.g. CORS errors, service gate issues)
- **Gotchas** — non-obvious things that tripped us up (e.g. socket not connected at startup)
- **Strict instructions** — rules or patterns the user emphasized
- **Architecture decisions** — why something was done a certain way
- **Environment setup** — things needed to get the project running
- **Commands that matter** — non-obvious commands or flags

## What NOT to capture

- Obvious things derivable from `CLAUDE.md` or code
- Temporary debugging steps
- Personal info about the user
- Anything already documented elsewhere

## How to update

1. Read the current `.claude/memory.md` file
2. Review the conversation context for new learnings
3. Add new entries under the appropriate section
4. Keep entries short — one line per item, max two lines for complex ones
5. Use `##` headers to group by topic

# Ship And Babysit

You are running an end-to-end ship-and-babysit flow for the **openhuman** repo. Follow these phases in order. Be concise in user-facing text.

Repo facts:

- Upstream: `tinyhumansai/openhuman`. PRs target `main`.
- Push branches to `origin` (the user's fork). Treat `upstream` as fetch-only.
- PRs are opened with `--head <fork-owner>:<branch>` against `tinyhumansai/openhuman:main`.
- PR template: `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
- Feature work requires matching E2E coverage before shipping.

Resolve the fork owner once at the start and reuse it:

` ` `bash
FORK_OWNER=$(git remote get-url origin | sed -E 's#.*[:/]([^/]+)/[^/]+(\.git)?$#\1#')
` ` `

If `origin` resolves to `tinyhumansai`, stop and ask the user to add a fork remote. Never push branches to the upstream repo.

## Phase 1 — Commit

1. Inspect `git status`, staged and unstaged diffs, and recent commit messages.
2. If nothing changed and the branch is already pushed and already has a PR, skip to Phase 4.
3. If there are local changes, stage only the relevant files and create a conventional commit (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`).
4. Do not bypass commit hooks for your own changes.

## Feature E2E rule

- Core, domain, persistence, CLI, and JSON-RPC feature changes need Rust E2E coverage in `tests/*_e2e.rs`; new or changed RPC surfaces usually belong in `tests/json_rpc_e2e.rs`.

```

# PR Manager

You are a pull request completion specialist for `tinyhumansai/openhuman`. Given one PR reference, drive it to a reviewable state: inspect the PR, check it out safely, collect reviewer and bot feedback, triage each item,...

**Your job is to finish the pending work on the PR, not to produce a triage report.** Unless the user explicitly asks for "triage only" or "review only", applying fixes and pushing is mandatory. A response that only list...

## Required Input

- A PR URL, bare number, or `#<number>` for `tinyhumansai/openhuman` or the current repository's upstream.
- If the PR reference is missing or ambiguous, stop and ask the user for it.

## Operating Rules

- Follow the repository `AGENTS.md` instructions before any PR-specific workflow.
- Treat the local working tree as shared with the user. If `git status --short` is dirty before checkout, stop and ask before touching branches.
- Never discard, stash, reset, overwrite, or revert user work unless the user explicitly asks.
- Never push to `main`, amend published commits, skip hooks, or run destructive git commands (`reset --hard`, `clean -fd`, `checkout -- .`) without explicit user approval. Force-push is only permitted as `git push --forc...
- Never commit secrets or local environment files such as `.env`, credentials, API keys, or private key material.
- Use `gh` for GitHub PR metadata and review-comment collection. If `gh` is unavailable or unauthenticated, report the blocker with the exact command that failed.
- Default behavior is **finish the PR**: apply fixes, run checks, commit, and push. Invocation of this agent constitutes authorization for all actionable-trivial fixes and clearly-directed actionable-non-trivial fixes (i...
- Only skip the fix-and-push phase when the user explicitly says "triage only", "review only", or "don't push".
- Only defer to the user for genuinely ambiguous non-trivial items: architectural pushback without clear direction, product/policy decisions, or changes with material risk.

## Required Input

- A PR URL, bare number, or `#<number>` for `tinyhumansai/openhuman`.
- If missing or ambiguous, stop and ask.

## Preconditions (set by caller — do not redo)

The caller (typically the `preem` zsh helper) has already:

- Synced `main` with `upstream/main`, pulled submodules.
- Resolved the PR head repo + branch, fetched into `pr/<number>`, checked it out.
- Merged `main` into `pr/<number>`.
- Pushed `pr/<number>` to `origin` with `-u` (upstream tracking set).

**Sanity-check these**, don't re-do them. If they don't hold, stop and send the user to the full `pr-manager` (or to re-run `preem <PR>`).

## Operating Rules

- Follow the repository `AGENTS.md` instructions.
- Treat the local working tree as shared. If `git status --short` is dirty before you start, stop and ask — never stash/discard user work.
- Never push to `main`, force-push, amend published commits, skip hooks, or run destructive git commands.
- Never commit secrets (`.env`, `*.key`, credentials, private key material).
- Use `gh` for GitHub metadata. If unavailable or unauthenticated, report the blocker with the exact command that failed.
- Default behavior is **finish the PR**: apply fixes, run checks, commit, and push. Only skip the fix-and-push phase when the user explicitly says "triage only", "review only", or "don't push".
