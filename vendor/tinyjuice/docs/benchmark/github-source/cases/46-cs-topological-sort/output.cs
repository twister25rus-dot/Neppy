/// <summary>
///     Topological Sort is a linear ordering of vertices in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
///     such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering.
///
///     KEY CONCEPTS:
///     1. Only applicable to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) - graphs with no cycles.
///     2. A DAG can have multiple valid topological orderings.
///     3. Used in dependency resolution, task scheduling, build systems, and course prerequisites.
///
///     ALGORITHM APPROACHES:
///     1. DFS-based (Depth-First Search): Uses post-order traversal and reverses the result.
///     2. Kahn's Algorithm: Uses in-degree counting and processes vertices with zero in-degree.
///
///     TIME COMPLEXITY: O(V + E) where V is vertices and E is edges.
///     SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(V) for the visited set and result stack.

    ///     Performs topological sort on a directed acyclic graph using DFS-based approach.
    ///
    ///     ALGORITHM STEPS (DFS-based approach):
    ///     1. Initialize a visited set to track processed vertices.
    ///     2. Initialize a stack to store the topological ordering.
    ///     3. For each unvisited vertex in the graph:
    ///        a) Perform DFS from that vertex.
    ///        b) After visiting all descendants, push the vertex to the stack.
    ///     4. The stack now contains vertices in reverse topological order.
    ///     5. Pop all vertices from the stack to get the topological ordering.
    ///
    ///     WHY IT WORKS:
    ///     - In DFS, we push a vertex to the stack only after visiting all its descendants.
    ///     - This ensures that all vertices that depend on the current vertex are processed first.
    ///     - Reversing this order gives us the topological sort.
    ///
    ///     EXAMPLE:
    ///     Graph: A → B → C
    ///            A → D
    ///            D → C
    ///     Valid topological orderings: [A, B, D, C] or [A, D, B, C].
    ///
    ///     USE CASES:
    ///     - Build systems (compile dependencies).
    ///     - Task scheduling with dependencies.
    ///     - Course prerequisite ordering.
    ///     - Package dependency resolution.

    ///     ALGORITHM STEPS (Kahn's Algorithm):
    ///     1. Calculate in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each vertex.
    ///     2. Add all vertices with in-degree 0 to a queue.
    ///     3. While the queue is not empty:
    ///        a) Remove a vertex from the queue and add it to the result.
    ///        b) For each neighbor of this vertex:
    ///           - Decrease its in-degree by 1.
    ///           - If in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue.
    ///     4. If all vertices are processed, return the result.
    ///     5. If not all vertices are processed, the graph has a cycle.
    ///
    ///     WHY IT WORKS:
    ///     - Vertices with in-degree 0 have no dependencies and can be processed first.
    ///     - After processing a vertex, we "remove" its outgoing edges by decreasing
    ///       the in-degree of its neighbors.
    ///     - This gradually reveals more vertices with in-degree 0.
    ///
    ///     ADVANTAGES OVER DFS:
    ///     - More intuitive for understanding dependencies.
    ///     - Easier to detect cycles (if not all vertices are processed).
    ///     - Better for parallel processing scenarios.
