//! Every type that crosses `TinyJuice`'s `TinyBus` boundary, and the names of
//! the members that carry them.
//!
//! A host loads the `tinyjuice-module` dynamic library but cannot import Rust
//! items from that binary. This transport-free crate is the ordinary library
//! that supplies its call vocabulary: interface names, request and response
//! types, and the compatibility rule for that vocabulary.
//!
//! It deliberately contains no `TinyBus` transport, runtime, or compression
//! behaviour. Hosts own their connection and policies; `tinyjuice-module` owns
//! the adapter; and the root `tinyjuice` crate remains host-agnostic and
//! re-exports the shared values from here rather than defining a second copy.
