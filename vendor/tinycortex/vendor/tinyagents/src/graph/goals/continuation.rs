//! Graph-native continuation for the thread goal.
//!
//! OpenHuman drives a goal from an out-of-band heartbeat: when a thread carries
//! an active goal and goes idle, the heartbeat injects one continuation turn,
//! marks the goal one-shot `continuation_suppressed`, and a later user turn
//! clears it. TinyAgents has no heartbeat and no ambient agent, so the same
//! behaviour is re-expressed on the graph runtime three ways:
//!
//! - [`goal_gate_node`] (**primary**) — a self-driving bounded loop. A
//!   command-routing node that, after each work iteration, folds the iteration's
//!   usage into the goal and routes back to the work node while the goal is
//!   Active and under budget, else routes to [`END`]. The graph's
//!   `recursion_limit` is the hard backstop.
//! - [`run_continuation_tick`] (**driver**) — a faithful port of the heartbeat
//!   for callers that *do* have an external scheduler: it selects idle active
//!   goals and runs one turn each through a caller-supplied closure.
//! - [`note_user_turn`] — call at the start of a user-initiated run to clear the
//!   one-shot suppression (and reactivate a paused goal), the analogue of
//!   OpenHuman's post-turn `account_turn_against_goal` suppression reset.
//!
//! # Token accounting boundary
//!
//! The graph runtime is provider-neutral and does not meter tokens per node.
//! Accounting is therefore **explicit**: the work node records what it spent
//! into `State` and the caller's `progress`/`run_turn` closure reports it as a
//! [`GoalProgress`]/[`TurnOutcome`]. `made_progress == false` stops the loop
//! (one-shot suppression) exactly as "the turn produced no tool calls" does in
//! OpenHuman.
