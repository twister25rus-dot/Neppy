//! Type definitions for the harness memory module.
//!
//! These types carry the conversation values that persist across runs in the
//! recursive runtime, so a thread can be paused and re-entered rather than
//! rebuilt from scratch on every turn.
//!
//! Memory is the conversation- and application-state capability of the harness,
//! distinct from graph checkpoints. It has two conceptual layers:
//!
//! - **Short-term** memory is thread-scoped conversation state (the messages of
//!   one [`ThreadId`]-keyed thread).
//! - **Long-term** memory is cross-thread application state, persisted through
//!   the harness [`Store`][crate::harness::store::Store].
//!
//! All public items are re-exported through [`super`]. Implementations and
//! tests live in the sibling `mod.rs` and `test.rs`.
