//! Type definitions for the harness observability and events layer.
//!
//! These types are the vocabulary for observing a recursive run tree: the
//! [`AgentEvent`] enum names every lifecycle transition (including the
//! sub-agent boundaries that mark one level of recursion), [`EventRecord`]
//! gives each event a replayable offset, and [`HarnessRunStatus`] threads the
//! `root_run_id` / `parent_run_id` lineage that ties a child run back to its
//! parent.
//!
//! All structs, enums, and traits in this module form the public surface of
//! `crate::harness::events`. Implementations, free functions, and tests live in
//! the sibling `mod.rs` and `test.rs` files.
