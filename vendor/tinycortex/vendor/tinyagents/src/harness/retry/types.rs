//! Types for retry, fallback, and rate-limiting policies.
//!
//! These declarative policy structs ([`RetryPolicy`], [`FallbackPolicy`],
//! [`RateLimiter`]) are the durability knobs the recursive harness applies to
//! the model call that every level of the recursion ultimately reduces to, so
//! the same resilience settings govern parent and nested calls alike. Each is
//! deterministically testable: backoff and the limiter take an explicit
//! `rand01` / `now` rather than reading a global clock or RNG.

/// Configures how a harness call is retried on transient failure.
///
/// Backoff grows exponentially: `initial_backoff_ms * multiplier^attempt`, then
/// capped at `max_backoff_ms`. When `jitter` is `true` the caller should use
/// [`RetryPolicy::backoff_for_attempt_with`] and supply a `[0, 1)` random
/// value; this avoids thundering-herd without making the implementation
/// non-deterministic for tests.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use tinyagents::harness::retry::RetryPolicy;
///
/// let policy = RetryPolicy::default();
/// assert!(policy.should_retry(0));
/// assert!(!policy.should_retry(3));
/// ```
