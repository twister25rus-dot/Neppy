//! Type definitions for the harness runtime facade.
//!
//! [`AgentHarness`] is the re-entrant runtime that the whole recursive
//! architecture stands inside: parent agents, nested sub-agents, subgraph
//! nodes, and model-authored blueprints all execute against the same composed
//! registries, middleware, and policy, so recursion reuses one runtime instead
//! of forking new ones. [`RunPolicy`] is the cross-cutting policy that runtime
//! enforces on every (parent or nested) run.
//!
//! [`RunPolicy`] is the declarative bundle of cross-cutting policy applied to
//! every run a harness drives (limits, retry, fallback, and a default response
//! format). [`AgentHarness`] is the high-level facade that wires a model
//! registry, a tool registry, a middleware stack, and a policy into a single
//! ergonomic entry point for the agent loop.
//!
//! All public items are re-exported through [`super`] so callers import from
//! `crate::harness::runtime` directly. Implementations and tests live in the
//! sibling `mod.rs` and `test.rs`.

/// A `RunPolicy` carries the four cross-cutting concerns the agent loop needs
/// to bound and steer a run:
///
/// - `limits`: hard caps (model calls, tool calls, wall-clock) enforced
///   fail-closed by the loop.
/// - `retry`: exponential-backoff retry policy applied to each model call.
/// - `fallback`: optional ordered chain of model names to try when the current
///   model exhausts its retries.
/// - `default_response_format`: when set, attached to every [`crate::harness::model::ModelRequest`]
///   the loop builds; a [`ResponseFormat::JsonSchema`] also drives structured
///   output extraction on the final response.
///
/// [`RunPolicy::default`] yields the crate-default limits and retry policy, no
/// fallback chain, no response format, and a [`CachePolicy`] whose response
/// caching is enabled — caching only takes effect once a [`ResponseCache`] is
/// actually attached via [`AgentHarness::with_response_cache`], so the default
/// is safe even without a cache.
/// How the agent loop reacts when the model calls a tool that is not
/// registered.
///
/// The default is [`UnknownToolPolicy::Fail`], preserving the historical
/// fail-fast behavior. The recoverable variants let a run keep going so the
/// model can correct itself — each recovery still consumes a tool-call budget
/// slot, so [`RunLimits::max_tool_calls`] bounds any unknown-tool loop.
