/// A shared, cheaply-cloneable cancellation flag for a [`super::ReplSession`].
///
/// A cell can otherwise only be stopped by its wall-clock
/// [`ReplPolicy::timeout`]. A host that drives sessions from an async runtime
/// (for example when a user cancels the surrounding run) needs to abort an
/// **in-flight** cell on demand, without waiting out the timeout. It holds a
/// clone of this flag and calls [`ReplCancelFlag::cancel`]; the session observes
/// it fail-closed at the same two enforcement points as the deadline:
///
/// - the engine `on_progress` hook, which terminates a running *script* at the
///   next statement/operation (a pure `while true {}` loop with no host calls);
/// - the blocking bridge around every `model_query`/`tool_call`/`agent_query`
///   call, which drops an in-flight (possibly hung) capability future promptly.
///
/// In both cases [`super::ReplSession::eval_cell`] returns
/// [`TinyAgentsError::Cancelled`](crate::error::TinyAgentsError::Cancelled). The
/// flag is *sticky*: once cancelled it stays cancelled, so a session observed as
/// cancelled will refuse to start further cells until a fresh flag is installed.
/// Construct one with [`ReplCancelFlag::new`] and install it with
/// [`super::ReplSession::with_cancel_flag`].
