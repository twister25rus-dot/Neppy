//! HTTP-backed embedding / LLM providers (feature `providers-http`).
//!
//! This module is the seam for reqwest-based provider implementations that back
//! the scoring and embedding signals with real network services. The concrete
//! providers (and their wire contracts) land with goals **C3** (embedding
//! providers) and **M3** (LLM providers); this module reserves the boundary and
//! gates the heavy [`reqwest`] dependency behind the `providers-http` feature so
//! the dependency-light core never links it.
//!
//! ## Embedding signature invariant
//!
//! Any embedding provider added here MUST report its identity as the canonical
//! signature string `provider=<name>;model=<model_id>;dims=<dims>` so that
//! vectors stay comparable across the store, retrieval, and re-embed backfill
//! paths. See `docs/plan/01-migration-library.md` §1.3.

/// Shared async HTTP client type for provider implementations.
///
/// Aliased here so the reqwest dependency stays confined to this feature-gated
/// module and provider code has a single, stable client type to build against.
/// As of this writing no provider implementation exists yet under this
/// module; the alias exists so future providers (goals **C3**/**M3**) share
/// one client type rather than each pulling `reqwest` in independently.
pub type HttpClient = reqwest::Client;

/// OpenRouter reference provider — the crate's first concrete `ChatProvider` /
/// `Summariser` / `EmbeddingBackend` (doc 06 §6.6). A reference implementation
/// only; the persona pipeline depends on the traits, not on this type.
