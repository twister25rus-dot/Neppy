//! Persona pipeline orchestration (doc 06 §6.5–§6.8): drives readers → digest →
//! facet-tree reduce → compile, with incremental cursors and run budgets.
//!
//! Two modes (§6.7): `Backfill` walks everything oldest-first so trees fold
//! chronologically; `Incremental` skips files/repos whose cursor is unchanged.
//! Both honour the run budget (max sessions / LLM calls); provider cost is
//! bounded by the provider's own per-run ceiling. Because evidence ids are
//! content-addressed, re-runs dedupe naturally — cursors are a fast-skip, not a
//! correctness gate.
