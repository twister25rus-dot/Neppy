//! Distillation map step (doc 06 §6.5): one `chat_for_json` call per extracted
//! session (or commit batch) turning a [`RawSession`] of redacted evidence into
//! a [`SessionDigest`] of per-facet, prescriptive observations.
//!
//! Follows the `LlmEntityExtractor` pattern: a strict-JSON instruction with the
//! schema in the prompt. Failure handling is deliberately **not** a silent
//! soft-fallback (that was the data-loss bug this module fixes):
//! - a provider/transport failure returns `Err` so the caller leaves the whole
//!   session non-committable and retries it next run;
//! - a truncated/unparseable response — the output-token cap cutting the JSON
//!   array short — is first *recovered* in-process by re-splitting the window
//!   into smaller pieces whose responses fit under the cap, and only a piece that
//!   still won't parse at the minimum size is dropped-and-counted (surfaced in
//!   the run report, never retried forever — a deterministically-bad window must
//!   not starve the queue);
//! - a cleanly-parsed empty response commits normally.
//!
//! Oversized sessions are windowed and digested part-by-part; each window is
//! digested independently, so one bad window never discards the clean siblings
//! that already digested — their observations are accumulated and kept.
