//! SQLite persistence for the memory-tree job queue (claim / enqueue side).
//!
//! Producers call [`enqueue`] inside their own writes (or with a fresh tx) to
//! atomically commit the side-effect plus its follow-up job. The worker pool
//! calls [`claim_next`] to lease a job; settlement (`mark_done` /
//! `mark_failed` / `mark_deferred` / recovery / requeue) lives in
//! [`super::store_settle`].
//!
//! All persistence lives in the shared `chunks.db` (opened via
//! [`crate::memory::chunks::with_connection`]) so a producer can insert its
//! side-effect and its follow-up job in one transaction. The `mem_tree_jobs`
//! table and its partial-unique dedupe index are owned by the chunks schema —
//! this module never issues DDL.
//!
//! Concurrency:
//! - The dedupe key is enforced by a partial `UNIQUE` index that only covers
//!   `status IN ('ready', 'running')`. Producers use `INSERT OR IGNORE` so a
//!   duplicate enqueue while a job is in flight or queued is a silent no-op; a
//!   duplicate enqueue after the first completes creates a fresh row.
//! - `claim_next` is one statement (`UPDATE … WHERE id = (SELECT … LIMIT 1)
//!   RETURNING …`). SQLite serialises writes, so no two workers claim the same
//!   row.
