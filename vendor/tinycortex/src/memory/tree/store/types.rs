//! Core persisted types for summary trees — ported from OpenHuman's
//! `memory_store/trees/types.rs`.
//!
//! These types sit on top of the chunk leaves. A [`Tree`] groups leaves under
//! one scope (e.g. one chat channel, one email account). When a [`Buffer`] at
//! some level accumulates enough tokens (L0) or siblings (L≥1), its contents
//! seal into a [`SummaryNode`] at level+1 and the buffer clears. Summary nodes
//! are immutable once emitted.
//!
//! Budgets are re-exported from [`crate::memory::config`] so there is a single
//! source of truth for the tunables (`INPUT_TOKEN_BUDGET`, `OUTPUT_TOKEN_BUDGET`,
//! `SUMMARY_FANOUT`); the engine reads them from [`crate::memory::config::TreeConfig`]
//! at runtime, these consts are the defaults/test references.
