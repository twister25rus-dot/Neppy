//! Typed failure + degradation model for the memory pipeline.
//!
//! The chunk→wiki pipeline and the time-tree summarizer fail in several
//! distinct ways (budget exhausted, missing/invalid key, missing local
//! model, dimension mismatch, extraction timeout, transient network).
//! Historically these all collapsed into an opaque error string and were
//! retried identically — so a hard "Insufficient budget" 4xx burned the
//! retry budget and the user saw a generic `error: N failed jobs`.
//!
//! This module is the single source of truth that fixes that:
//!
//! - [`FailureCode`] enumerates every distinguishable cause.
//! - Each code maps to a [`FailureClass`] (`Transient` ⇒ retry with
//!   backoff, `Unrecoverable` ⇒ fail fast) and a stable i18n
//!   `remediation_key` so the status surface / doctor / job row all show
//!   consistent, actionable text. Embeddings remediation leads with the
//!   local-Ollama path (the steered primary fix), with BYO key secondary.
//! - [`PipelineFailure`] is a `std::error::Error`, so it can be wrapped in
//!   `anyhow` and propagated up through the job processor, then downcast in
//!   the queue worker to decide retry-vs-fail.
//! - [`DegradedState`] captures "the pipeline ran but recall/structure is
//!   reduced" — surfaced so degraded output is never presented as success.
//!
//! ## Scope: taxonomy only
//!
//! This is the engine's own failure vocabulary and nothing else. The
//! *process-global degradation flags* that the embed/extract stages set and the
//! `pipeline_status` RPC reads stay in the embedding host, because they are
//! coupled to a host socket broadcast and to host plumbing. So does the
//! `doctor` report (it reads the host's scheduler-gate config) and the
//! user-error publisher (its `kind` string is a pinned frontend contract).
//!
//! Note the name: `tinycortex_api::health` is a *different* thing — driver
//! liveness (`MemoryHealth`). This module is pipeline failure classification.
//!
//! The `remediation_key` values are i18n keys resolved by the host's frontend.
//! They travel with [`FailureCode`] because `PipelineFailure::remediation_key`
//! is a serialized wire field populated by `PipelineFailure::new`; splitting the
//! table out would change the type's shape. The emitted strings are unchanged.
