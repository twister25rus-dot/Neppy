//! Snapshot-based change tracking for memory sources.
//!
//! After each sync, this module captures what's in the chunk store for a source,
//! then diffs against previous snapshots to surface additions, removals, and
//! modifications — helping agents understand how their world view has changed
//! over time.
//!
//! Snapshots are built from **already-ingested** data (supplied by an injected
//! `SnapshotItemSource`, not by re-calling source readers), so diffs cost no
//! upstream API calls. The authoritative store remains whatever backs the item
//! source; this module's storage is a *derived* git ledger.
//!
//! ## Git ledger
//!
//! Storage is a git repository at `<workspace>/memory_diff/repo` (the diff
//! *ledger*):
//!
//! - Snapshot → git commit (`Snapshot.id` is the commit SHA).
//! - Checkpoint → annotated tag `ckpt_<uuid>` at HEAD.
//! - Read marker → ref `refs/openhuman/read/<encoded_source_id>`.
//! - Diff → git tree diff scoped to a source path.
//!
//! See the ledger module for the mapping and `DiffEngine` for the operations.
//!
//! ## Decoupling from `chunks`
//!
//! The chunk store is ported separately, so the engine takes a
//! `SnapshotItemSource` by injection rather than hard-depending on
//! `chunks`. `InMemoryItemSource` is a reference/test backend.
//!
//! ## Operations
//!
//! - `DiffEngine::take_snapshot` / `DiffEngine::auto_snapshot_after_sync`
//! - `DiffEngine::list_snapshots`
//! - `DiffEngine::compute_diff` (explicit pair)
//! - `DiffEngine::diff_since_last` (latest vs previous)
//! - `DiffEngine::diff_since_read` (latest vs read marker, optional advance)
//! - `DiffEngine::mark_read`
//! - `DiffEngine::create_checkpoint` / `DiffEngine::list_checkpoints`
//! - `DiffEngine::diff_since_checkpoint` (cross-source)
//! - `DiffEngine::cleanup`

//! ## Type carve-out — what compiles WITHOUT `git-diff`
//!
//! `types` and `source` are `serde`/`std`-only: they name no git concept and
//! reach no `git2` symbol. They stay **ungated**, so a host that does not want
//! libgit2 in its dependency graph can still describe a diff — pass a
//! `CrossSourceDiff` around, match on a `ChangeKind`, implement a
//! `SnapshotItemSource` — it simply cannot *compute* one.
//!
//! That distinction is what makes the gate usable downstream. OpenHuman's
//! always-on subconscious profile renders `CrossSourceDiff` / `ChangeKind` in
//! prompts, and stubbing those types rather than sharing them would mean two
//! definitions of the same serde shape drifting apart silently. The rule
//! (OpenHuman's AGENTS.md, "Compile-time domain gates") is: put a domain's
//! inert types in a dependency-free submodule and leave it ungated; gate only
//! the behaviour.
//!
//! Gated on `git-diff`: `ledger` + `ledger_helpers` (the only two modules that
//! touch `git2` directly), `checkpoint` / `diff` / `snapshot` (whose impls are
//! all written against `Ledger`), and `DiffEngine` itself — the engine's inherent
//! methods live in those modules, so an ungated `DiffEngine` would be a handle
//! with nothing to call.
