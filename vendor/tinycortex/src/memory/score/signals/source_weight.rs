//! Source-weight signal — per-provider base weight derived from the
//! `DataSource` when it can be inferred from a chunk's tags.
//!
//! Rationale:
//! - High-intentionality messaging (direct DMs, personal emails) scores higher
//! - Broadcast/channel content scores lower
//! - Documents authored by the user score higher than shared-but-unmodified drops
//!
//! Phase 2 takes a conservative approach: per-[`DataSource`] base weight.
//! Finer distinction (DM vs channel on Slack specifically) requires richer
//! ingest-time metadata and is deferred.
