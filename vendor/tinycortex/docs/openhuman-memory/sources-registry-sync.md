# Sources, Registry, and Sync Spec

OpenHuman modules: `memory_sources`, `memory_sync`.

## Responsibility

The source registry answers "what feeds memory?" Sync pipelines answer "how do
we pull from upstream and land data into memory?" Canonicalizers normalize
upstream payloads into a common markdown shape for ingestion.

## Ownership Boundary

TinyCortex should preserve source, reader, sync, and canonicalization contracts
because they define provenance and integration shape. TinyCortex should not own
memory sync. Live sync is OpenHuman-owned and is responsible for
polling, webhook/OAuth event handling, source scheduling, and deciding when to
call TinyCortex on demand.

## Source Registry

Sources are persisted as `[[memory_sources]]` entries in `config.toml`.

Common fields:

- `id`, `kind`, `label`, `enabled`.
- optional sync budgets: `max_tokens_per_sync`, `max_cost_per_sync_usd`.
- optional `sync_depth_days`.

Kinds and required fields:

- `composio`: `toolkit`, `connection_id`.
- `conversation`: no kind-specific fields.
- `folder`: `path`, optional `glob`.
- `github_repo`: `url`, optional `branch`, `paths`, `max_commits`,
  `max_issues`, `max_prs`.
- `twitter_query`: `query`, optional `since_days`; sync is currently
  placeholder.
- `rss_feed`: `url`, optional `max_items`.
- `web_page`: `url`, optional `selector`.

Validation is runtime/discriminator-based because kind-specific fields are
flattened optional fields on one struct.

## Registry Operations

Required CRUD:

- `add_source`
- `get_source`
- `list_sources`
- `list_enabled_by_kind`
- `update_source`
- `remove_source`
- `upsert_composio_source`

Mutations must load current config, modify, validate, and save atomically.
OpenHuman lazily reconciles active Composio connections on list, so integrations
connected before process boot become visible without restart.

## Source Readers

The `SourceReader` trait must support listing items and reading item content.
Reader output:

- `SourceItem`: `id`, `title`, optional `updated_at_ms`.
- `SourceContent`: `id`, `title`, `body`, `content_type`, `metadata`.
- `ContentType`: `markdown`, `html`, `plaintext`.

TinyCortex currently ships local readers only:

- Folder reader: glob files, default markdown pattern, 10 MB cap, path traversal
  guard.
- Conversation reader: local legacy-thread source integration over
  `<workspace>/threads/*.json`; this is separate from the JSONL conversation
  store under `memory/conversations/`.

The network-backed source kinds remain part of the registry and validation
contract, but their live fetchers are OpenHuman/host-owned sync adapters:

- GitHub reader adapter: commits, issues, PRs via `gh` CLI or public REST
  fallback.
- RSS reader adapter: RSS/Atom item extraction.
- Web page reader adapter: fetch URL and optionally select content by CSS
  selector.
- Composio reader adapter: provider-driven sync owns real fetch.
- Twitter reader adapter: placeholder until credentials/API path exist.

In TinyCortex, `reader_for` should return a local reader for `folder` and
`conversation`, and `None` for network-backed kinds so the host can route them
through its sync runner.

## Manual Sync

Manual sync is an OpenHuman-owned sync behavior. It should return immediately after
queuing/backgrounding work, and progress is communicated through memory sync
stage events with source id/connection id. Stages include requested, fetching,
stored, ingesting, completed, and failed.

Reader-backed sources and Composio-backed sources are sync implementations in
OpenHuman. Their TinyCortex boundary is the on-demand ingest call: once
OpenHuman has selected content, it passes source-scoped payloads through the
TinyCortex ingest/storage/tree contracts.

## Status and Cost Surfaces

OpenHuman exposes source status by querying chunks matching source-id prefixes.
Freshness labels:

- active: last chunk within 30 seconds.
- recent: last chunk within 5 minutes.
- idle: no chunk or older activity.

Additional source RPC surfaces include supported toolkits, sync audit log, sync
cost estimate, monthly cost summary, and all-in/apply-all setup.

## Sync Pipelines

OpenHuman owns the production sync runner. TinyCortex should treat these
pipeline types as compatibility contracts and optional adapters, not as proof
that TinyCortex owns source scheduling.

`SyncPipelineKind` values:

- `composio`
- `workspace`
- `mcp`

Each pipeline implements:

- `id()`
- `kind()`
- `init(config)`
- `tick(config) -> SyncOutcome`

`SyncOutcome` contains `records_ingested`, `more_pending`, and optional `note`.
Pipelines own pagination, cursors, rate limits, and retries. The orchestrator
owns cadence.

OpenHuman-owned background loops:

- Composio periodic: 20-minute tick and per-connection interval.
- Workspace periodic: 20-minute tick; default daily source sync interval.
- Queue scheduler: stale buffer flush and transient-failure recovery.

## Canonicalization

Canonicalization produces `CanonicalisedSource { markdown, metadata }`.

Adapters:

- Chat: sorted `## <ts> - <author>` blocks; empty input returns `None`.
- Document: trimmed markdown; time range is modified-at point.
- Email: message blocks with From/Subject/Date plus cleaned body.
- Email clean helpers: strip reply chains, legal/footer boilerplate, truncate,
  escape markdown, extract email, parse dates.

Canonicalizers must not interpret semantic meaning and must not emit a leading
title header. Titles/provenance belong in content-store front matter.

## Raw Archive Coverage

OpenHuman records raw files summarized by a batch in `mem_tree_ingested_sources`
with `source_kind = raw_file`. Reconciliation diffs disk against gate state and
summarizes uncovered remainder. TinyCortex should preserve this self-healing
behavior so interrupted syncs do not strand raw files.

## Controller Namespace

Namespace: `memory_sources`.

This namespace is an OpenHuman/host adapter surface. TinyCortex currently owns
the registry, validation, local reader trait, and local folder/conversation
readers; controller functions that schedule sync, expose audit/cost status, or
call network readers are deferred to the host sync layer.

Functions:

- `list`, `get`, `add`, `update`, `remove`
- `list_items`, `read_item`, `sync`, `reconcile`
- `status_list`, `supported_toolkits`
- `sync_audit_log`, `estimate_sync_cost`, `monthly_cost_summary`
- `apply_all_in`

## TinyCortex Landing Area

```text
src/memory/sources/
  readers/
src/memory/ingest/canonicalize/
```

Port order: source kind/types/validation, registry patch semantics, reader
trait and static reader contracts, canonicalizer pure functions, then
OpenHuman-facing ingest and sync adapters. Reusable provider fetch, pagination,
and canonicalization pipeline mechanics are crate-owned; the live sync runner,
credentials, scheduling, callbacks, policy, RPC, and product events stay in
OpenHuman.
