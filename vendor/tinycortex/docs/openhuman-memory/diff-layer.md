# Diff Layer Spec

OpenHuman module: `memory_diff`.

## Responsibility

`memory_diff` tracks how memory sources change over time. It does not fetch
upstream data. It snapshots the already-ingested chunk store, materializes a
derived git ledger, and exposes diffs, checkpoints, and read markers so agents
can understand what changed since a sync or since their last read.

## Source of Truth

`mem_tree_chunks` remains authoritative. The git ledger at
`<workspace>/memory_diff/repo` is rebuildable derived state.

## Git Mapping

- Snapshot: git commit.
- Snapshot id: commit SHA.
- Checkpoint: annotated tag `ckpt_<uuid>`.
- Read marker: `refs/openhuman/read/<encoded_source_id>`.
- Diff: git tree diff between commit trees scoped to source path.

Each snapshot commit replaces one source subtree and carries other source
subtrees forward from the parent. All writes must serialize through a process
lock because HEAD and parent resolution are read-modify-write operations.

## Snapshot Model

`Snapshot` fields:

- `id`
- `source_id`
- `source_kind`
- `label`
- `trigger`: `auto` or `manual`
- `item_count`
- `taken_at_ms`

Snapshot metadata rides in commit message trailers. Snapshot content is one
flat blob per source item under an encoded source-id directory; source id and
item id are both encoded into git-safe path components. The public
`Snapshot.source_id` remains the original logical id from commit trailers.

## Item Diff Model

Change kinds:

- `added`
- `removed`
- `modified`

`ItemChange` includes:

- `item_id`
- `title`
- `kind`
- optional `old_content_hash`
- optional `new_content_hash`
- optional bounded `text_diff`

`DiffSummary` includes added, removed, modified, and unchanged counts.
`DiffResult` includes source metadata, from/to snapshot ids, summary, and
per-item changes. `CrossSourceDiff` aggregates per-source diffs for a
checkpoint.

## Snapshot Capture

Snapshot capture:

1. Build a source id prefix.
2. Query `mem_tree_chunks` matching the prefix.
3. Group chunk content by item id.
4. Order content by source id and sequence.
5. Commit one blob per item into the ledger.
6. Optionally let the host publish a `MemoryDiffSnapshotTaken` event. TinyCortex
   itself has no event bus in this port.

Manual snapshot uses `SnapshotTrigger::Manual`. Successful source sync should
call `auto_snapshot_after_sync` with `SnapshotTrigger::Auto`.

## Diff Operations

Required business operations:

- `take_snapshot(source, config, trigger)`
- `auto_snapshot_after_sync(source, config)`
- `compute_diff(config, from_snapshot_id, to_snapshot_id, include_text_diff)`
- `diff_since_last(source, config, include_text_diff)`
- `diff_since_read(source, config, include_text_diff, commit)`
- `mark_read(source_ids | all)`
- `create_checkpoint(label)`
- `list_checkpoints(limit)`
- `diff_since_checkpoint(checkpoint_id, include_text_diff)`
- `cleanup(older_than_days)`

Cross-source direct diff must be rejected when from/to snapshots belong to
different sources.

## Read Markers

`diff_since_read` compares a source's head snapshot to its read marker. If
`commit = true`, it advances the marker after computing the diff. Default
behavior acknowledges reads so repeated calls return only newer changes.
`commit = false` previews without acknowledgement.

## Controller Namespace

Namespace: `memory_diff`.

This namespace is an OpenHuman/host adapter surface. TinyCortex currently owns
the git-backed domain engine and Rust operations below; RPC/controller wiring is
deferred.

Functions:

- `take_snapshot`
- `list_snapshots`
- `diff`
- `diff_since_last`
- `diff_since_read`
- `mark_read`
- `create_checkpoint`
- `list_checkpoints`
- `diff_since_checkpoint`
- `cleanup`

## Agent Tool

OpenHuman `MemoryDiffTool` exposes in-conversation change awareness by wrapping
the diff engine. TinyCortex keeps the machine-readable domain output the tool
needs; the agent-tool adapter itself is deferred. Tool output must preserve ids,
source labels, counts, and item changes. Text diffs should remain bounded to
avoid overwhelming context.

## Required Invariants

- Never re-fetch upstream data to compute a diff.
- Ledger writes are serialized.
- Snapshot item identity is item id, not title.
- Item rename is represented as removed plus added.
- Commit/message metadata must round-trip into `Snapshot`.
- Text diffs are capped.
- Ledger errors must surface as unhealthy diff state, not silent empty results.

## TinyCortex Landing Area

```text
src/memory/diff/
  types.rs
  ledger.rs
  source.rs
  snapshot.rs
  checkpoint.rs
  diff.rs

src/memory/controllers/   # deferred RPC adapter layer
src/memory/tools/         # deferred agent-tool adapter layer
```

Port order: types and serde tests, item-id encoding, snapshot metadata
round-trip, in-memory/git tempdir tests, then chunk-store integration.
