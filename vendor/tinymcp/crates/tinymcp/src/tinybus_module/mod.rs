//! The `TinyBus` module: the interface, its state, and the ABI exports.
//!
//! This adapter is the only thing in the crate that knows about `TinyBus`.
//! Everything it serves is the ordinary library API underneath, so the crate
//! stays usable as a plain dependency — which is what lets a host consume it as
//! a path dependency first and a loadable module later without the code in
//! between changing.
//!
//! # The names come from the contract
//!
//! Every member name, the interface, and the object path are spelled once, in
//! [`tinymcp_bus::names`]. The manifest below repeats them because the macro
//! needs literals, and a test asserts the two agree — a member served but not
//! declared is invisible to a host, and one declared but not served is an
//! unknown-method failure at the worst possible moment.
//!
//! # Arguments are positional
//!
//! `TinyBus` decodes a member's arguments from a JSON array by position. That
//! makes the *order* of a method's parameters part of the contract, not just
//! their types: swapping two parameters of the same type is a silent breaking
//! change. Each signature below matches the order documented on its member.
