//! A Model Context Protocol client, packaged as an installable `TinyBus`
//! module.
//!
//! This crate knows how to *talk to* MCP servers. It dials them over Streamable
//! HTTP or as a subprocess, browses the upstream registries, keeps track of what
//! a user installed, supervises what it spawned, and records what got written.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! This is the implementation half of a two-crate workspace:
//!
//! - [`tinymcp_bus`] — the wire contract. Member names, payload types, and the
//!   contract version, with no transport and no behavior. A host that only
//!   makes calls depends on that crate alone and compiles neither this crate
//!   nor `tinybus`.
//! - `tinymcp` — this crate. The transports, the registry, the audit log, and
//!   the `TinyBus` adapter that serves them, built as both an `rlib` and the
//!   `cdylib` the loader consumes.
//!
//! Every public item from the contract is re-exported here, so
//! `tinymcp::McpRemoteTool` is the *same type* as `tinymcp_bus::McpRemoteTool`
//! rather than a structural twin, and a caller takes one dependency instead of
//! two.
//!
//! # Untrusted input is the design constraint
//!
//! Everything this crate talks to was chosen by a user and vetted by nobody: an
//! arbitrary HTTPS endpoint, or an arbitrary subprocess launched through `npx`
//! or `uvx`. Three rules follow, and they are worth knowing before reading any
//! of the code.
//!
//! **Remote text is sanitized before it can reach a model.** Tool descriptions
//! and titles are read through the display accessors on
//! [`McpRemoteTool`], which apply [`tinymcp_bus::sanitize`].
//!
//! **Endpoints are redacted before they are logged.** [`redact_endpoint`]
//! reduces a URL to scheme and authority and refuses anything carrying
//! userinfo. MCP endpoints routinely carry an API key in a query parameter.
//!
//! **Tool permission is enforced before the transport.** A denied tool never
//! reaches the network or a subprocess.
//!
//! # Errors
//!
//! Every fallible public function returns [`Result`], the crate alias over
//! [`Error`]. One variant is worth singling out: [`Error::Unauthorized`] means
//! the server is reachable and wants credentials, which is a state a caller
//! acts on rather than reports. Match on it with [`Error::is_unauthorized`]
//! rather than reading a message.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use tinymcp::{redact_endpoint, render_tool_result};
//!
//! // An endpoint is never logged raw.
//! assert_eq!(
//!     redact_endpoint("https://example.test/mcp?api_key=secret"),
//!     "https://example.test",
//! );
//!
//! // A raw `tools/call` reply renders into the shape a caller consumes.
//! let rendered = render_tool_result(&serde_json::json!({
//!     "content": [{ "type": "text", "text": "sunny, 21C" }],
//! }));
//! assert!(!rendered.is_error);
//! assert_eq!(rendered.text(), "sunny, 21C");
//! ```
