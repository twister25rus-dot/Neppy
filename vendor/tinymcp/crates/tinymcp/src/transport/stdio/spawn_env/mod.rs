//! Working out the environment a stdio MCP server should be spawned into.
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! An application launched from a desktop environment — Finder or `launchd` on
//! macOS, a shell-less session on Linux — inherits a **stripped** `PATH`,
//! typically just `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`. That path has no Homebrew, no
//! `/usr/local/bin`, and none of the Node or Python version-manager shims that
//! `nvm`, `volta`, `bun`, and `uv` install.
//!
//! Most of the MCP ecosystem ships as `npx <package>` or `uvx <package>`. So a
//! server the user can run perfectly well in their terminal fails to spawn with
//! a bare `ENOENT`, and nothing in that error suggests the cause is a path.
//!
//! # What this does about it
//!
//! Reconstructs the path a terminal would have given the child:
//!
//! 1. Probe the user's interactive login shell (`$SHELL -ilc`) for its `$PATH`,
//!    so version managers that hook into shell startup files are honored.
//! 2. Keep a list of well-known version-manager directories as a fallback, for
//!    when the probe is unavailable — a sandbox with no interactive shell, a
//!    startup file that never exports a path, a hung profile.
//! 3. Merge them, de-duplicated, first occurrence winning.
//!
//! When the probe succeeds it is authoritative: the shell's path leads and the
//! fallback directories only fill gaps, so they never override the Node version
//! the user's shell selected. When it fails, the fallback leads instead.
//!
//! The result is computed once per process and cached, because the probe spawns
//! a login shell and running that per server would be both slow and rude.
//!
//! # Failing before the spawn
//!
//! [`locate_command`] resolves a command the way the operating system will, and
//! [`missing_command_error`] turns a miss into guidance that names the runtime
//! the user is actually missing. Checking first is what turns "ENOENT" into
//! "this server needs Node.js, which is not installed".
