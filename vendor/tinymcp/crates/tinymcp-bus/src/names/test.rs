//! The table is the one place a member name is spelled, so what matters here is
//! that it stays internally consistent: no duplicates, no empties, and a shape
//! every member agrees on. A host that calls a member this list does not
//! contain gets a runtime "unknown method", which is precisely the failure the
//! table exists to convert into a compile error.
