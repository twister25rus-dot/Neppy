//! The version describes *this vocabulary*, not the crate: bump the major
//! component when a payload's wire form changes incompatibly or a member is
//! removed or renamed, and the minor component when a member or an optional
//! field is added. It is deliberately independent of the package version the
//! release workflow bumps, which tracks the shipped artifact.

/// reporting `module`.
///
/// Compatibility is the ordinary semantic-version rule for a pre-release-free
/// contract: the majors must match, and the module must be at least as new as
/// the host, because a host cannot call a member a module does not serve.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use tinymcp_bus::{is_compatible, CONTRACT_VERSION};
/// assert!(is_compatible(CONTRACT_VERSION));
/// assert!(is_compatible((1, 4)));
/// assert!(!is_compatible((2, 0)));
/// ```
