//! The two provider traits every backend implements.
//!
//! [`Host`] answers *which machine* — it can run a command and move bytes
//! somewhere. [`Sandbox`] answers *what confines it* — it owns box lifecycle,
//! isolation, and snapshots. Backends implement one or the other, never both,
//! which is what lets `ssh` and `docker` compose without either knowing about
//! the other.
//!
//! Both traits are object-safe and used as `Arc<dyn _>` in a provider registry,
//! which is why they carry `async_trait` rather than native `async fn`. Both
//! also require `Debug`, because the types holding them derive it and
//! `missing_debug_implementations` is denied workspace-wide.
//!
//! # Implementing a sandbox honestly
//!
//! [`Sandbox::capabilities`] must describe what the backend really does. Core
//! checks the declaration before dispatching and surfaces
//! [`Error::Unsupported`], so a backend should
//! return an accurate [`SandboxCapabilities`] and let the check fail rather
//! than emulate something it cannot deliver.
