//! Crate-wide error and result types.
//!
//! Every fallible public function in this crate returns [`Result`], and every
//! failure mode is a distinct [`Error`] variant. Add a variant rather than
//! encoding new context into an existing message: callers match on variants,
//! and message text is not a stable API.
//!
//! Variants carry the data a caller needs to react, keep their `#[error]`
//! message lowercase and free of trailing punctuation, and are documented so
//! the rendered rustdoc explains when each one occurs.
