//! What a box is: where it runs, what code it holds, and what it may consume.
//!
//! # Why reach and confinement are separate
//!
//! SSH answers *which machine* a process runs on. Docker answers *what
//! confines it*. They are different questions, so tinybox models them as two
//! independent choices joined by a [`Placement`]:
//!
//! ```text
//! Host — reach                     Sandbox — confinement
//! ├─ local                         ├─ passthrough
//! └─ ssh                           ├─ docker
//!                                  ├─ namespace
//!                                  └─ microvm
//! ```
//!
//! Composition then costs nothing: `ssh` + `docker` is Docker on a remote
//! machine without a line of code dedicated to that pairing. Folding the two
//! axes into one enum would instead require a variant per combination.
//!
//! # Why a box names two placements
//!
//! The runner — the tinybox agent driving the work — and the workspace — where
//! the user's code actually executes — need not sit in the same place. A local
//! runner can drive a remote workspace, or a containerized runner can drive a
//! microVM workspace. [`BoxSpec::runner`] and [`BoxSpec::workspace`] are
//! therefore independent; [`BoxSpec::new`] colocates them for the common case,
//! and [`BoxSpec::with_runner`] splits them apart.
//!
//! ```
//! use tinybox_core::identity::{HostRef, SandboxRef};
//! use tinybox_core::spec::{BoxSpec, Placement, WorkspaceSource};
//!
//! let local = Placement::new(HostRef::new("local")?, SandboxRef::new("docker")?);
//! let spec = BoxSpec::new(local, WorkspaceSource::OciImage("alpine:3".into()));
//!
//! assert_eq!(spec.runner, spec.workspace);
//! # Ok::<(), tinybox_core::Error>(())
//! ```
