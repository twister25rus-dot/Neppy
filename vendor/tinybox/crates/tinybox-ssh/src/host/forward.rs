//! Making a port on the far machine reachable from this one.

//! Everything else in this crate builds a command line and hands it to an inner
//! [`Host`](tinybox_core::Host) to run to completion. A tunnel cannot work that
//! way: it *is* the running process, and it has to outlive the call that
//! created it. So this module spawns `ssh -N -L` directly and hands the child
//! to a [`Forward`] guard, which kills it on drop.
