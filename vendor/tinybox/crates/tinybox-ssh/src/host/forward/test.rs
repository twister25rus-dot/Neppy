//! Tests for the SSH port forward.
//!
//! Driving a real tunnel needs a real sshd, which is `live_ssh.rs`'s job. What
//! is checked here is everything that does not: the flags chosen, the refusal a
//! chained host gets, and — by standing an ordinary child process in for `ssh`
//! — that waiting really does resolve when a listener appears and really does
//! give up when the child dies.
