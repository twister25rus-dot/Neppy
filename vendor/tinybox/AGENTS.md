# Repository Guidelines

This file is the single source of truth for how humans and coding agents work
in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to this file, so every agent reads
the same instructions.

This repository is a Rust 2024 Cargo **workspace** implementing tinybox, a
workspace containerization runtime. See
[`docs/specs/tinybox-runtime.md`](docs/specs/tinybox-runtime.md) for the model
and [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for what is built and what is next.

```

Every crate the spec names now exists. Do not scaffold an empty one; that is a
placeholder.

Each feature area is a directory module under a crate's `src/`. A module root
explains the module, wires its pieces together, and exposes the smallest useful
API. Move substantial type definitions into `types.rs` and put module-local
unit tests in a dedicated `test.rs`, wired from the bottom of the module root
with:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod test;
```

Do not accumulate inline `mod tests` blocks in implementation files, and do not
let a general-purpose `utils.rs` or `helpers.rs` grow — those are a symptom of a
missing module. Prefer many small modules that each do one thing well over few
broad ones.

Keep public exports centralized in each crate's `src/lib.rs`. Put shared error
variants in `tinybox-core`'s `src/error/mod.rs` and return the crate-wide
`Result<T>` from fallible public APIs.

## Two rules specific to this runtime

1. **A backend never emulates a capability it has not declared.** Every
   `Sandbox` returns a `SandboxCapabilities`; core checks it and returns
   `Error::Unsupported`. Approximating a capability — copying a filesystem
   because real forking is unavailable, or running a bare process where
   isolation was requested — is the one failure mode that silently converts
   "contained" into "not contained". Add a capability and declare it, or return
   the error.
2. **Reach and confinement stay orthogonal.** `Host` answers which machine,
   `Sandbox` answers what confines the process. Do not add a backend that
   merges the two (`DockerOverSsh` and its relatives); compose a `Placement`
   instead. See ADR 0002.
3. **A backend that drives an external tool runs it through its `Host`**, never
   through a native protocol client bound to a local socket. That is what keeps
   rule 2 true in practice, and it keeps command construction pure and
   testable. See ADR 0004.
4. **Adding a field to a stored type needs `#[serde(default)]`.** `BoxSpec`,
   `BoxInfo`, and `ExecRequest` are written to a user's box store; a field
   without a default makes an older store unreadable and orphans every box in
   it. Think about what the default *means*, too — `BoxInfo::created_at`
   defaults to `None` rather than the epoch, because "unknown age" must not read
   as "ancient" to the reaper.
5. **Time comes from a `Clock`, never `SystemTime::now`.** A test that waits an
   hour for a box to expire is not a test anyone will run.

## Build And Test

Run every command from the repository root. These four are the contract; CI
runs exactly them, so a green local run should mean a green CI run.

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo build --all-targets --all-features
cargo test --all-features
```

Supporting commands:

- `cargo fmt --all` — format before committing.
- `cargo test <filter>` — run a focused subset while iterating.
- `cargo run -p tinybox-core --example basic` — run the bundled example.
- `cargo build --release -p tinybox-module --lib` — build the installable
  cdylib. A virtual workspace needs the explicit `-p`.
- `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features` — build the rustdoc CI also builds with
  `RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"`.
- `cargo test --doc` — run doctests alone when editing documentation examples.

Never skip, ignore, or delete a failing test to make a command pass. Fix the
root cause, or stop and report the blocker.

## Coding Style

Use standard `rustfmt` output and Rust 2024 idioms. Do not hand-format around
`rustfmt`, and do not add `#[rustfmt::skip]` without a comment explaining why.

- `snake_case` for modules, files, functions, methods, fields, and locals.
- `PascalCase` for types, traits, and enum variants; `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for
  constants and statics.
- Name things for what they are, not for their layer: `RetryPolicy`, not
  `RetryHelper`.
- Prefer small, typed APIs over stringly-typed ones. Accept `&str` and generic
  `impl Into<String>` at boundaries; return owned, concrete types.
- Keep the public surface minimal: default to private, and export deliberately
  from `src/lib.rs`.
- `unsafe` is forbidden across the workspace by `[workspace.lints]` in the root
  `Cargo.toml`, which every crate inherits with `[lints] workspace = true`.
  **No crate relaxes it.** ADR 0003 reserved `tinybox-linux` as the one that
  might; ADR 0005 records why it did not need to. If you find yourself wanting
  `unsafe`, check first whether an existing tool already does the dangerous part
  correctly — that is how the namespace backend avoided it.

### Errors

- One workspace-wide `Error` enum in `crates/tinybox-core/src/error/mod.rs`,
  built with `thiserror`.
- Fallible public functions return `Result<T>`, the crate alias.
- Add a specific variant instead of stuffing context into a string; error
  messages are lowercase, without trailing punctuation.
- Do not `unwrap()`, `expect()`, or `panic!` anywhere the lints reach, which is
  every target — library, tests, examples, and benches alike. Examples return
  `Result` from `main`; tests return `Result` and use `?`. See the Testing
  section for how to assert a failure without panicking.
- Document a `# Errors` section on every public fallible function and a
  `# Panics` section on anything that can panic.

### Dependencies

Adding a dependency is a design decision. Before adding one, check whether the
standard library or an existing dependency already covers the need. When you do
add one:

- pin a caret range (`serde = "1"`), not an exact version;
- enable only the features you need, with `default-features = false` when that
  meaningfully trims the tree;
- gate anything optional behind a Cargo feature, documented in `Cargo.toml`;
- leave a comment above the entry explaining *why* the crate is needed and what
  uses it — see the existing entries for the expected tone;
- prefer well-maintained crates with a compatible license.

Keep `Cargo.lock` committed; this crate ships a lockfile so CI and releases are
reproducible.

### Vendored dependencies

TinyBus is registered as the `vendor/tinybus` git submodule and pinned by its
gitlink. It supplies the host types and module-side SDK required to build this
crate's `cdylib`. Initialize it after cloning with:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Do not edit vendored code from the parent repository. Make TinyBus changes in
its own repository, push them there, then update this repository's gitlink in a
separate commit. Keep the exact path dependencies and minimal features unless a
new module capability requires more.

## Testing

- Module-local unit tests live in `crates/<crate>/src/<feature>/test.rs` and may
  touch private items.
- `unwrap_used`, `expect_used`, and `panic` are denied in **test** targets too.
  Return `Result` from a test and use `?` for paths that should succeed; assert
  failures with `.err()` against an expected variant, or `assert!(matches!(..))`.
- Integration tests live in `tests/` and exercise only the public API — they are
  the regression suite for the crate's contract.
- Use descriptive, behavioral test names: `rejects_an_empty_name`, not
  `test_greet_2`.
- Cover the failure paths, not just the happy path. Every new error variant
  needs a test that produces it.
- For async behavior, standardize on one runtime (`tokio` as a dev-dependency
  for tests) rather than mixing runtimes.
- Tests must be deterministic and independent of network, wall-clock time, and
  execution order. Gate any live/network test behind a feature or an env var and
  name it `live_*` so it is easy to exclude.
- Maintain at least 90% line coverage in every source file **individually** —
  the gate is per file, not aggregate, and it is the dominant cost on new code.
  Keep impure I/O behind a narrow injectable trait so the logic around it is
  unit-testable without a live daemon. Add or update tests
  with every behavior change, and note any deliberately untested edge case in
  the pull request description.

Write the test first when fixing a bug: a failing test that reproduces the
report, then the fix that turns it green.

## Documentation

Write documentation for the reader who has never seen the code.

- Every public item gets a rustdoc comment. `missing_docs` is a warning that CI
  treats as an error.
- Start every `mod.rs` and `test.rs` with a concise module-level `//!`
  description.
- `src/lib.rs` carries the crate-level overview: what the crate does, the
  primary entry points, and a short runnable example.
- Prefer concrete examples over vague description. Doc examples are compiled and
  run by `cargo test`, so they cannot drift.
- Complex modules must include a module-level `README.md` covering their design,
  public surface, and important operational constraints.
- Keep `README.md`, `docs/`, and module docs aligned with code changes in the
  same commit that changes behavior.
- Write accepted behavior and constraints in `docs/specs/` before creating a
  linked, implementation-ordered plan in `docs/plans/`. Specs define what and
  why; plans define how and in what sequence.
- Keep every Markdown file, including this one, at 500 lines or fewer. When a
  topic outgrows that, split it into focused files and link them from the
  nearest `README.md`.

## Git Workflow

- Never commit directly to `main`. Branch first, one branch per logical change.
- Do feature work in a git worktree so the main checkout stays clean.
- Commit subjects are concise and imperative: `Add retry policy to the client`.
  Keep the subject specific to the change and under ~72 characters.
- Make small, focused commits. Each commit should cover one logical change,
  build independently, and avoid mixing formatting, refactors, and behavior
  changes unless they are inseparable.
- Never commit secrets. `.env` is git-ignored; document new variables in
  `.env.example` with placeholder values.
- Never force-push a shared branch, rewrite published history, or bypass hooks
  with `--no-verify`.

## Pull Requests

Open pull requests ready for review, not as drafts, unless the work genuinely
must not merge yet. A pull request should:

- summarize what changed and why, in a few sentences;
- call out public API or behavior changes explicitly, or state "None";
- list the validation commands actually run, with their outcome;
- link the related issue;
- include updated tests, docs, and examples in the same change.

The template in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` encodes this checklist.
Address review feedback by fixing it, and reply on each thread describing what
changed. Do not resolve a thread whose feedback you have not addressed or
explicitly declined with a reason.

## Releases

Releases run from `.github/workflows/release.yml` via a manual
`workflow_dispatch` with a `patch` / `minor` / `major` bump; `current` resumes
an interrupted release after its version commit and tag exist. The workflow
re-runs the full validation suite, computes the next version, updates
`Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock`, commits and tags `vX.Y.Z`, builds the TinyBus
module for every supported platform, pushes, and creates an immutable GitHub
release with installable native packages.

Consequently:

- Do not hand-edit the `version` field in `[workspace.package]`; the release
  workflow owns it, and every member inherits it.
- Follow semantic versioning. Any change to the public surface that is not
  purely additive is a breaking change and needs a major bump (pre-1.0: a minor
  bump).
- The module must be packageable for every release target — `main` should
  always be green.

## Agent Working Agreement

For automated contributors specifically:

1. **Read before writing.** Inspect the surrounding module and match its
   conventions, comment density, and idiom rather than importing a house style.
2. **Verify, do not assume.** Run the four contract commands and read their
   output before reporting a task complete. Report failures with the output;
   never claim a check passed that you did not run.
3. **Stay in scope.** Implement what was asked. Do not opportunistically
   refactor, reformat, upgrade dependencies, or "fix" unrelated code — raise it
   instead.
4. **No placeholders in delivered code.** No `todo!()`, no stubbed functions, no
   commented-out alternatives left behind. If something cannot be finished, say
   so explicitly.
5. **Do not weaken the guardrails.** Never add blanket `#[allow(...)]`, relax a
   lint, mark a test `#[ignore]`, or loosen CI to get a green run. Fix the
   cause.
6. **Secrets stay out.** Never read, echo, or commit `.env` contents, tokens, or
   credentials, and never paste them into a pull request or issue.
7. **Ask only when blocked.** Make routine judgment calls yourself; escalate
   only irreversible decisions or genuine forks with no clear default.
