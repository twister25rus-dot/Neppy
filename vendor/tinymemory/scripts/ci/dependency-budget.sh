#
# Issue #18 §D5. The point of the contract crate and of `--no-default-features`
# is that a host which wants memory ports and nothing else does not compile a
# storage engine, a native library, or an HTTP stack. That property is invisible
# in a diff: a dependency arrives transitively, through a feature enabled two
# crates away, and the PR that causes it looks innocent. Printing the numbers on
# every run makes the regression visible on the PR that caused it, which is the
# only moment it is cheap to fix.
#
# The ceiling applies only to the minimal configuration. The richer ones are
# reported, not gated: their sizes are a consequence of what an engine needs,
# and a number nobody chose is not a budget worth failing on.

# Deliberately generous: the minimal build links 40 crates today. This is a
# ratchet against accidental growth, not a target to optimise towards — a limit
# set at today's exact count would fail on the first legitimate addition and get
# raised without thought, which teaches everyone to ignore it.
