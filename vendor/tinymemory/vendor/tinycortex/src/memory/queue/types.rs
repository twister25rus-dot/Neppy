//! Job types for the async memory-tree pipeline.
//!
//! Each `Job` row in `mem_tree_jobs` stores its discriminator as a string
//! `kind` plus a JSON-encoded `payload`. The strongly-typed payload structs
//! below own (de)serialisation; handlers parse the payload by branching on
//! [`JobKind`] and calling the matching `from_payload_json`.
//!
//! Ported from OpenHuman's `memory_queue::types`. The one substitution: the
//! upstream typed-failure classifier lived in `memory_tree::health`
//! (`PipelineFailure`), which is not part of this crate's ported surface, so a
//! small self-contained [`JobFailure`] replaces it here. It preserves the same
//! contract the queue cares about: a machine-readable `code`, a `class`
//! (`transient` / `unrecoverable`), and [`JobFailure::is_unrecoverable`].
