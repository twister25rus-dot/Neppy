//! The TinyCortex memory engine.
//!
//! A layered, config-driven memory system ported from OpenHuman. The layering
//! rule from the spec holds: orchestration and ingestion depend on storage;
//! storage never depends upward on orchestration, tools, or agents.
//!
//! ## Layers
//!
//! - [`types`] / [`traits`] / [`config`] / [`error`]: stable shared contracts.
//! - [`store`]: storage primitives (content, chunks, trees, vectors, KV, …).
//! - [`chunks`]: canonical chunk model and deterministic ids.
//! - [`sources`]: source registry contracts and validation.
//! - [`score`]: scoring, entity extraction, and embedding signals.
//! - [`tree`]: summary-tree mechanics (append, seal, summarise, retrieve).
//! - [`queue`]: async job model (extract, append, seal, flush, backfill).
//! - [`retrieval`]: vector / keyword / graph / tree / hybrid search.
//! - `diff`: git-backed source snapshots, diffs, checkpoints, read markers.
//!   Its inert `types`/`source` submodules are always compiled; computing a
//!   diff needs feature `git-diff`, which gates the heavy native
//!   `git2`/libgit2 dependency.
//! - [`entities`] / [`graph`]: entity files and derived co-occurrence graph.
//! - [`goals`] / [`tool_memory`]: specialized long-term memory surfaces.
//! - [`conversations`] / [`archivist`]: transcript storage and tree archival.
//! - [`ingest`]: the canonicalize → chunk → score → tree ingest pipeline.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! - **Local-first workspace.** [`MemoryConfig::workspace`] is the single
//!   authoritative root: markdown content, SQLite indexes, and ledgers all live
//!   under it. Nothing in this crate treats a remote service as the source of
//!   truth; remote sync (Gmail, Slack, Notion, …) only ever writes through the
//!   same local pipeline as any other content.
//! - **Storage never depends upward.** `store`, `chunks`, and `sources` may be
//!   used by `tree`, `queue`, `retrieval`, `ingest`, and the higher-level
//!   surfaces, never the other way around. This keeps the storage layer testable
//!   and reusable without pulling in orchestration.
//! - **Crash-safe writes.** Anything that mutates on-disk state (trees, KV,
//!   markdown documents, ledgers) goes through [`fsutil`]'s atomic
//!   write-then-rename helpers so a crash mid-write never leaves a torn file
//!   readers can observe.
//! - **Provenance taint fails closed.** [`types::MemoryTaint`] defaults to
//!   [`types::MemoryTaint::Internal`] for first-class in-process content, but
//!   any unrecognised persisted value decodes as
//!   [`types::MemoryTaint::ExternalSync`] — the more restrictive setting — so
//!   policy gates never under-trust content of unknown provenance.
//! - **Feature-gated modules add no default-build cost.** `providers` and
//!   `persona` are compiled out entirely unless their feature is enabled, and
//!   `diff` keeps only its inert `types`/`source` submodules without `git-diff`
//!   (see the crate-level feature-flag docs in `lib.rs`). Code in this module
//!   must not assume any of them is present.
