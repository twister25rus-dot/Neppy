//! Persistence for the scoring layer:
//!
//! - `mem_tree_score` — per-chunk score rationale (which signals fired, why
//!   dropped/kept).
//! - `mem_tree_entity_index` — inverted index `entity_id → node_id` so
//!   retrieval can resolve entity-scoped queries in O(lookup).
//!
//! The schema is declared centrally in `memory::chunks` (`schema.rs::SCHEMA`);
//! this file only owns the CRUD operations against those tables.
//!
//! ## Atomicity
//!
//! Every write function comes in two forms: a `with_connection`-scoped
//! variant (`upsert_score`, `index_entities`, `clear_entity_index_for_node`,
//! …) that opens its own implicit transaction, and a `_tx` variant that takes
//! a caller-owned [`Transaction`] so the write commits atomically with
//! surrounding ingest writes (e.g. the chunk insert). Callers persisting a
//! score alongside its chunk should use the `_tx` variants via
//! [`crate::memory::score::persist_score_tx`] rather than the standalone
//! ones, to avoid a chunk being visible with no matching score row (or vice
//! versa) if the process crashes mid-ingest. All upserts are
//! `INSERT OR REPLACE`, so retrying a write after a crash is safe (idempotent
//! on the row's primary key) — except that `INSERT OR REPLACE` never
//! *deletes* rows, which is why re-indexing a chunk's entities always calls
//! [`crate::memory::score::store::clear_entity_index_for_node`] first (see
//! that function's docs).
//!
//! ## Divergence from OpenHuman
//!
//! The `mem_tree_score` table in TinyCortex does not carry `llm_importance` /
//! `llm_importance_reason` columns, so those fields are admission-time signals
//! only: the persisted row records the resulting `total`. They are kept on
//! `ScoreRow` / [`ScoreSignals`] for API compatibility and read back as their
//! defaults (`0.0` / `None`). TinyCortex also has no identity registry, so the
//! `is_user` column is always written as `0`.
