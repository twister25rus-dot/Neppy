//! Entity canonicalisation / cross-platform merge (Phase 2 / #708, V1).
//!
//! Exact-match only: normalises surface forms (lowercase emails, strip leading
//! `@` on handles) and assigns a canonical `entity_id` string.
//!
//! Fuzzy matching (alice-slack ≡ Alice-Discord by soft match) is deferred until
//! we have real entity-graph data — the current implementation handles the
//! mechanical cases cleanly without producing false merges.
