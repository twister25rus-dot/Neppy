//! Scoring / admission / enrichment pipeline.
//!
//! Wraps extraction, signal computation, the admission gate, entity
//! canonicalisation, and persistence into one call per chunk. The ingest path
//! passes each chunk through [`score_chunk`] after chunking and before storing.
//!
//! ## Trait seams
//!
//! Two backends are abstracted so the crate never calls a real model:
//! - [`extract::EntityExtractor`] — the always-on regex extractor plus the
//!   optional LLM NER + **importance rater** consulted only on borderline
//!   chunks. The default config uses no LLM (a no-op importance signal of
//!   `0.0`); a host wires an [`extract::LlmEntityExtractor`] over its own
//!   [`extract::ChatProvider`].
//! - [`embed::Embedder`] — the embedding backend, defaulting to the
//!   deterministic [`embed::InertEmbedder`].
//!
//! ## Position in the layer diagram
//!
//! `score` sits between [`crate::memory::chunks`] (produces the [`Chunk`]s
//! it scores) and [`crate::memory::tree`]/[`crate::memory::queue`] (which
//! call [`score_chunk`]/[`score_chunks`] during ingest and act on
//! [`ScoreResult::kept`]). Per the crate-wide layering rule, `score` never
//! calls upward into `tree`, `queue`, or `retrieval`.
//!
//! ## Concurrency / atomicity
//!
//! [`score_chunk`] itself is pure-ish (no store access) and safe to call
//! concurrently for different chunks — the only shared state is whatever the
//! configured [`extract::EntityExtractor`] / LLM provider holds internally.
//! Persistence ([`persist_score`] / [`persist_score_tx`]) is where atomicity
//! matters: use the `_tx` variant when persisting a score alongside its chunk
//! write so both land in the same SQLite transaction (see
//! [`store`]'s module docs for the full write contract).
