//! Source readers: the [`SourceReader`] trait plus local implementations.
//!
//! A reader knows how to *list* the items available in a source and *read* the
//! content of one item. The trait is intentionally narrow so the host can drive
//! ingestion uniformly across every source kind.
//!
//! ## Ownership boundary
//!
//! Fetching and parsing a source is engine work, so the `github_repo`,
//! `rss_feed`, and `web_page` readers live here behind the `sync` feature
//! alongside the always-compiled local kinds ([`folder::FolderReader`],
//! [`conversation::ConversationReader`]). What TinyCortex still does **not**
//! own is *when* a network read happens: scheduling, polling cadence, OAuth,
//! credentials, and egress/cost budgeting stay with the host.
//!
//! That is why [`reader_for`] and [`is_locally_readable`] draw their line at
//! **local vs. network**, not at implemented vs. absent. A network reader is
//! constructed explicitly (`github::GithubReader`, `rss::RssReader`,
//! `web_page::WebPageReader`) by a caller that has already decided the fetch is
//! allowed; it is never handed out by the kind-dispatch that
//! [`crate::memory::sync::workspace`] drives on a timer. A `None` from
//! [`reader_for`] therefore still means "route this through the host's sync
//! runner", which is what keeps the host in charge of hitting the network.
//!
//! `composio` and `twitter_query` have no reader here at all — the former is a
//! credentialed OAuth pipeline, the latter is unimplemented.
