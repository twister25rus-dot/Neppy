//! `fetch_leaves` — batch-fetch raw chunks by id and project them into the
//! unified [`RetrievalHit`] shape.
//!
//! The contract, ported from OpenHuman's `memory_tree::retrieval::fetch`:
//! "given these chunk ids, give me the full content + metadata so I can cite."
//! The batch is capped by retrieval config to keep the round-trip bounded. Missing
//! ids are silently skipped — the return is best-effort, so partial failures
//! are visible via `hits.len() < ids.len()`.
//!
//! Each hit is annotated with the chunk's score from `mem_tree_score` when
//! available; score is `0.0` when the chunk has no score row. Two batched
//! reads (chunks + scores) replace `2N` per-id queries.
