//! One-shot SQLite migrations for the chunk DB.
//!
//! Each migration is version-gated via `PRAGMA user_version` so it runs exactly
//! once per vault. Called from [`super::connection`] during DB initialisation.
//!
//! ## Contract
//! Both migrations are version-gated. Database-only work and its version marker
//! share a transaction. Migrations with filesystem cleanup complete that
//! cleanup before recording the version so an interruption remains retryable.
//!
//! Neither migration is exercised by an automated test in this module (audit
//! test-coverage gap) — both are asserted only via the module's behavior at
//! `connection::init_db` call time.
