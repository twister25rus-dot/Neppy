//! Cold-start error classification, stale-file cleanup, and corrupt-DB
//! recovery for the chunk SQLite database.
//!
//! Three independent concerns live here:
//! - [`is_io_open_error`] / [`try_cleanup_stale_files`]: the retry path wired
//!   into [`super::connection::get_or_init_connection`] for the *cold-start*
//!   WAL/SHM bootstrap race (a fresh process opening a DB whose side-files
//!   are mid-write from another process).
//! - [`is_transient_cold_start`]: a second, overlapping classifier for the
//!   same error family, currently exercised only by tests (see NOTE on its
//!   doc comment).
//! - [`recover_corrupt_db`] / [`quick_check_ok`]: a `SQLITE_CORRUPT`
//!   quarantine-and-rebuild path serialized by the connection cache's per-path
//!   initialization lock and used by cold-open recovery and runtime loops.
//!
//! [`try_cleanup_stale_files`] never unlinks the `-wal`: it first attempts a
//! `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` and, only if that fails, quarantines the `-wal`
//! by renaming it to a timestamped `.quarantine` sibling so committed data is
//! preserved for manual recovery (audit finding SC-4). Only the `-shm` is
//! deleted outright. It targets the specific cold-start bootstrap races, not
//! a general-purpose "fix a stuck DB" hammer.
