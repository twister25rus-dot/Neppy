//! Canonical evidence model for persona distillation (doc 06 §6.3).
//!
//! Everything the readers emit and the pipeline consumes is expressed in terms
//! of the contracts here: the [`PersonaSourceKind`] a unit of evidence came
//! from, its [`EvidenceTier`] (confidence ladder), the [`PersonaFacet`]s it
//! informs, and the redacted [`PersonaEvidence`] excerpt itself. The LLM map
//! step (§6.5) turns a batch of evidence into a [`SessionDigest`].
//!
//! ## Redaction boundary (fail-closed)
//!
//! [`PersonaEvidence`] can only be constructed through [`PersonaEvidence::new`],
//! which runs the raw excerpt through
//! [`sanitize_text`] *before* the
//! value is stored on the struct. `sanitize_text` is the composite redactor: it
//! scrubs secrets/tokens/keys (OpenAI `sk-…`, GitHub `gh*_…`, OAuth/bearer
//! credentials) *and* runs the formatted-PII pass
//! ([`redact_pii`](crate::memory::store::safety::pii::redact_pii)) the plan
//! names in §6.3 — the stronger of the two, chosen because transcripts are full
//! of tokens and keys, not just national-id-shaped PII. There is no way to build
//! evidence from unredacted text, so nothing unredacted can leave the reader
//! layer or reach an LLM. The struct field is private to enforce this.
//!
//! ## Deterministic ids
//!
//! Evidence ids are content-addressed — `sha256(source_id ‖ excerpt)[..32]` —
//! mirroring the archivist leaf-id convention so re-runs dedupe naturally.
