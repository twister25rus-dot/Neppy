//! Source readers (doc 06 §6.4): stream a source's on-disk history and emit
//! redacted [`PersonaEvidence`], one [`RawSession`] per logical session / file /
//! commit batch.
//!
//! The shared principle is **extract the person, discard the machine**: only
//! user decisions, corrections, and prompts are kept; tool output, reasoning,
//! file dumps, and vendor scaffolding are dropped. Each reader records the raw
//! bytes it walked and the bytes it kept so the ≥95% reduction contract is
//! measurable (see [`RawSession::reduction_ratio`]).
//!
//! Readers stream line-at-a-time and never materialise a whole session file.
