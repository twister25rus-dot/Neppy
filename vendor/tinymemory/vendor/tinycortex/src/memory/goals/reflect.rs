//! Turn-based reflection over the goals list.
//!
//! In OpenHuman, reflection is performed by a real multi-turn agent
//! (`goals_agent`, restricted to the `goals_*` tools + `memory_recall`): it
//! reads the current list, considers a supplied context, and applies
//! add/edit/delete over several turns. On an empty list (first run) it
//! bootstraps an initial set; otherwise it makes the *minimal* set of justified
//! changes.
//!
//! TinyCortex does not call a real LLM. Instead the LLM step is abstracted
//! behind the [`GoalsGenerator`] trait, which — given the current document, the
//! context, and a `first_run` flag — proposes a list of [`GoalMutation`]s. The
//! *deterministic* part of reflection (applying mutations, de-duplicating
//! additions, and re-enforcing the persistence caps) is ported faithfully here
//! and is fully testable without any model.
//!
//! The "minimal changes unless empty" decision from OpenHuman is preserved:
//! [`reflect`] computes `first_run` from the loaded document and threads it (and
//! the corresponding [`build_prompt`] instruction) into the generator. The
//! default [`NoopGenerator`] proposes nothing, so reflecting a non-empty list is
//! a no-op — exactly the "make no churn unless justified" behaviour.
