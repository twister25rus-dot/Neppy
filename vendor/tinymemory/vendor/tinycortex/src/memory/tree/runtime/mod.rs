//! Hierarchical time-based markdown summary tree.
//!
//! Organises summaries as a tree: root → year → month → day → hour (leaf). A
//! summarisation job drains buffered raw content, summarises it into the hour
//! leaf, and propagates updated summaries upward. Stored as markdown files under
//! `{workspace}/memory/namespaces/{ns}/tree/`.
//!
//! Ported from OpenHuman's `memory_tree/tree_runtime/`. The LLM is abstracted
//! behind [`engine::Summariser`]; the RPC/CLI/bus/schema surfaces are not ported.
