//! Subgraph node adapters — the graph-level recursion surface where a graph
//! runs another graph.
//!
//! This is the structural counterpart to harness sub-agents (a model calling a
//! model): here an entire [`CompiledGraph`] is embedded *as a node* inside a
//! parent graph, so "graphs that run graphs" is just an ordinary node handler.
//! Each embedding extends the child's checkpoint namespace with the embedding
//! node id, which keeps every level of a recursively
//! nested run durable and collision-free, and the executor's recursion limit
//! bounds how deep that nesting can go.
//!
//! See [`types`] for the conceptual overview of the two embedding modes. The
//! functions here wrap a [`CompiledGraph`] into a node handler usable with
//! [`crate::graph::GraphBuilder::add_node`]:
//!
//! - [`shared_subgraph_node`] — parent and child share one state channel.
//! - [`adapter_subgraph_node`] — parent and child use different state shapes,
//!   bridged by `to_child` / `from_child` mappings.
