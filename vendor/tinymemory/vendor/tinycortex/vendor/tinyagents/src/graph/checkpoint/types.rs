//! Checkpoint records and metadata — the persisted snapshots that make every
//! level of a recursive graph run resumable and forkable.
//!
//! Checkpoints are graph-runtime persistence, separate from harness memory and
//! long-term stores. They are written at superstep boundaries only — never
//! mid-node — because rerunning a node from its start is far easier to reason
//! about than suspending an async Rust stack, and it matches interrupt/resume
//! semantics exactly.
//!
//! Each record carries a `thread_id` lineage key, a `parent_checkpoint_id`
//! chain (the spine that time-travel and forking walk), and a `namespace` that
//! scopes nested subgraph checkpoints so a parent run and the child graphs it
//! embeds never overwrite each other.
