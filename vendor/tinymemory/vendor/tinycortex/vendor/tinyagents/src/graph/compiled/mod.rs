//! Superstep executor for the durable graph.
//!
//! This is the engine that makes the recursive runtime durable: it drives a
//! [`CompiledGraph`] in checkpointed supersteps, and because a node handler may
//! recurse into another compiled graph (a subgraph) or a sub-agent, every level
//! of that recursion is observed through the same step/boundary/checkpoint
//! discipline — child runs roll their state, events, and interrupts up through
//! the parent's reducer and checkpointer.
//!
//! The executor runs in supersteps. Each step: take the active node set, run
//! each active node against the committed state snapshot, collect updates /
//! commands / interrupts, apply the reducer at the step boundary, persist a
//! checkpoint at the boundary (when a checkpointer is configured), then select
//! the next active set. The loop stops when the active set empties, every
//! branch reaches [`END`], an interrupt pauses the run, or the recursion limit
//! is hit (a deterministic [`TinyAgentsError::RecursionLimit`]).
//!
//! By default execution is sequential within a step. When the graph is compiled
//! with [`crate::graph::GraphBuilder::with_parallel`], a step with more than one
//! active node runs every branch concurrently via
//! [`futures::future::join_all`], yet the data flow — snapshot reads, boundary
//! reducer application, boundary checkpointing — is identical: each branch reads
//! the same committed snapshot (its own clone), and results are folded into the
//! reducer in deterministic active-set order at the step boundary, so the merged
//! state is reproducible regardless of which branch finishes first.
//!
//! ## Concurrency and interrupt semantics
//!
//! - All active branches in a parallel step start before any is awaited, and all
//!   are driven to completion (`join_all`) before the step boundary runs.
//! - Branch results are then folded in active-set index order. The reducer is
//!   the fan-in / join: lower-index branches' updates are applied first.
//! - The *lowest-index* branch that errors or interrupts is the step's terminal
//!   outcome. Updates produced by lower-index successful branches are still
//!   applied/persisted; an error persists a resumable failure boundary (see
//!   below) and aborts, an interrupt persists a checkpoint whose pending nodes
//!   are that branch and every later active node.
//! - Because branches run on cloned snapshots and never share mutable state,
//!   concurrency is data-race free; the reducer alone resolves conflicting
//!   writes (deterministically, by index).
//!
//! ## Network resilience and resumable failures
//!
//! Two opt-in mechanisms make a run durable under transient failure and
//! restartable after a hard one:
//!
//! - **Node retry.** With
//!   [`CompiledGraph::with_node_retry`], a node whose handler fails with a
//!   [retryable][crate::harness::retry::is_retryable] error (a model or tool
//!   error — the transient class) is re-run from its start up to the policy's
//!   attempt cap, emitting
//!   [`GraphEvent::NodeRetryScheduled`](crate::graph::stream::GraphEvent::NodeRetryScheduled)
//!   and sleeping the opt-in backoff between attempts. A single network blip is
//!   absorbed without touching the run.
//! - **Resumable failure.** When a handler fails beyond the retry budget (or the
//!   error is non-retryable), the executor does not discard the step. On a
//!   checkpointed thread it folds the branches that already completed into
//!   committed state and persists a failure-boundary checkpoint whose
//!   `next_nodes` schedule the failed node (and the not-yet-run tail) for a
//!   later [`CompiledGraph::resume`]/[`CompiledGraph::retry`], with the error
//!   and failed node stamped into the checkpoint metadata. The run then reports
//!   `Failed` (carrying that checkpoint id) and returns the error. A caller can
//!   restart it as-is, or continue on operator feedback by editing state with
//!   [`CompiledGraph::update_state`] before resuming. Without a checkpointer the
//!   run aborts immediately, exactly as before.
