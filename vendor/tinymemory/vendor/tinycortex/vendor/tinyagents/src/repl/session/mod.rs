//! Rhai-backed `.ragsh` session runtime (design milestone R2).
//!
//! [`ReplSession`] is the imperative counterpart to the declarative `.rag`
//! language: an orchestrator (a human, or a model acting as one) drives a
//! session one *cell* at a time. Each cell is a small Rhai script evaluated
//! against a **persistent namespace** — top-level `let` bindings survive into
//! the next cell, exactly like the persistent locals of a Recursive Language
//! Model REPL — while model, tool, and graph capabilities are exposed as
//! host-registered functions rather than script-native side effects.
//!
//! This module implements the runtime core of milestone R2:
//!
//! - an [`rhai::Engine`] configured with
//!   [`set_max_operations`](rhai::Engine::set_max_operations) so a runaway
//!   script *fails closed* instead of hanging the host;
//! - a persistent [`rhai::Scope`] shared across cells;
//! - captured `print` output, returned values, and changed variables;
//! - `emit(...)` and `answer(...)` built-ins recorded as typed data;
//! - byte limits on both script input and captured output;
//! - restoration of reserved core names after every cell so a script can add
//!   locals but cannot permanently replace `context`, `answer`, `model_query`,
//!   `graph_run`, or any other reserved capability.
//!
//! Capability functions (`model_query`, `tool_call`, `graph_run`, the
//! `graph_*` blueprint surface, …) are wired to the real registries by later
//! slices; this slice establishes the session, policy, and result types they
//! plug into. Generated graph topology is never installed directly — it must
//! pass through the `.rag` compiler, the capability resolver, and the policy
//! review gate.
//!
//! The whole module is gated behind the `repl` cargo feature so the default
//! build does not pull in the Rhai engine.
