//! Types for run-scoped limit enforcement.
//!
//! [`RunLimits`] carries the configured policy — including the
//! [`RunLimits::max_depth`] recursion cap that bounds how far the sub-agent /
//! sub-graph run tree may nest; [`LimitTracker`] (in the sibling `mod.rs`)
//! holds the live counters and checks them against the policy.

/// Configures the hard limits applied across a single harness run.
///
/// All limits are checked fail-closed: the first call that exceeds a cap
/// returns an error and the run should be stopped.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use tinyagents::harness::limits::RunLimits;
///
/// let limits = RunLimits::default()
///     .with_max_model_calls(10)
///     .with_max_tool_calls(20);
/// ```
