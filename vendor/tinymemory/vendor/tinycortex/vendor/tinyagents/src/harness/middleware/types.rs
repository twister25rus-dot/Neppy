//! Type definitions for the harness middleware module.
//!
//! These are the typed extension points that wrap each level of the recursive
//! harness: the [`Middleware`] trait's hooks fire identically around the parent
//! agent loop and around every nested model/tool/agent call beneath it, so
//! observation and policy compose the same way at any recursion depth.
//!
//! This file holds every public type in `crate::harness::middleware`: the
//! [`AgentRun`] result record, the core [`Middleware`] trait, the
//! [`MiddlewareStack`] composer, and the built-in middleware implementations.
//! Behavioral code (trait default bodies, the stack runner, and built-in
//! `Middleware` impls) lives in the sibling `mod.rs`; focused tests live in
//! `test.rs`.
//!
//! All public items are re-exported through [`super`] so callers import from
//! `crate::harness::middleware` directly.

/// updating its counters and message log as model and tool calls complete, and
/// hands a `&mut AgentRun` to [`Middleware::after_agent`] so middleware can
/// inspect or post-process the final result without owning loop state.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use tinyagents::harness::middleware::AgentRun;

///

/// order while `after_*` hooks run in **reverse** registration order. The first
/// registered middleware is therefore the outermost layer: it sets up first and
/// tears down last, mirroring common web-middleware stacks and keeping cleanup
/// symmetrical.
///
/// # Mutation
///
/// Hooks receive mutable references to the value flowing through the run
/// (`request`, `delta`, `response`, `call`, `result`) so they can transform it
/// in place. They also receive `&mut RunContext<Ctx>` for emitting events and
/// recording limits, plus a shared `&State` for read-only application state.
