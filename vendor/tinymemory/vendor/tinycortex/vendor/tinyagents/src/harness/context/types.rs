//! Type definitions for the harness run-context module.
//!
//! These types carry the recursion bookkeeping (depth / max-depth) and the
//! shared signals (cancellation, steering, events) that let a parent run and
//! its nested sub-runs behave as one coordinated tree.
//!
//! [`RunConfig`] is the serializable, declarative description of a run (its
//! identity, limits, and metadata). [`RunContext`] is the live, in-process
//! handle threaded through model calls, tool calls, middleware, and graph
//! nodes; it bundles the config with the dependencies a run needs (stores,
//! events, and limit tracking) plus arbitrary user data.
//!
//! All public items are re-exported through [`super`] so callers import from
//! `crate::harness::context` directly. Implementations and tests live in the
//! sibling `mod.rs` and `test.rs`.

/// `RunConfig` captures everything that defines a run independent of live
/// runtime state: its identity, the thread it belongs to, classification tags,
/// free-form metadata, and the hard limits applied to it. Because it is
/// `Serialize`/`Deserialize`, a run can be described, stored, and replayed.
///
/// Construct one with [`RunConfig::new`] and refine it with the `with_*`
/// builder methods.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use tinyagents::harness::context::RunConfig;
///
/// let config = RunConfig::new("run-1")
///     .with_thread("thread-7")
///     .with_tag("nightly")
///     .with_max_model_calls(10);
/// assert_eq!(config.run_id.as_str(), "run-1");
/// assert_eq!(config.max_model_calls, 10);
