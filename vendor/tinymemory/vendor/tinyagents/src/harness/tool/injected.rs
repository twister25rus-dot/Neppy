//! Injected (hidden) tool arguments: values the *host* supplies, never the
//! model.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! Some tool arguments are not the model's business: the caller's thread id,
//! the recursion depth, the id of the tool call being answered, a database
//! handle, an authenticated user. Today a tool that needs them reaches around
//! the argument schema entirely — `SubAgentTool` reads `context.thread_id` and
//! `context.depth` off [`ToolExecutionContext`][super::ToolExecutionContext]
//! because there is no declarative way to *receive* them — which means every
//! such tool re-invents the plumbing and none of it is visible in the tool's
//! declared shape.
//!
//! LangChain models this as `InjectedToolArg` / `InjectedToolCallId`
//! annotations, strips them from the model-facing `tool_call_schema`, and
//! LangGraph's `ToolNode` re-injects the real values at execution time.
//!
//! # The ordering rule (security-critical)
//!
//! At execution time the sequence must be, in this order:
//!
//! 1. **Strip** every injected key from the model-supplied arguments.
//! 2. **Validate** the remaining arguments against the model-facing schema.
//! 3. **Inject** the host's real values.
//! 4. Invoke the tool.
//!
//! Step 1 must come first and must be unconditional. A model that has seen an
//! injected key named in a prompt, a log, or an error message can put that key
//! in its own `arguments` object; if the host merges its value in *after*, a
//! well-formed merge might still let the model's value win, and if the host
//! merges *before* validating, the forged key rides along. LangGraph's
//! `ToolNode` strips first for exactly this reason, with the comment that it
//! "prevents an LLM from forging hidden InjectedToolArg fields via
//! ToolCall.args".
//!
//! [`strip_injected_arguments`] performs step 1 and reports what it removed, so
//! a forgery attempt is visible in the log rather than silent.
//!
//! # Status
//!
//! The declaration side is live: [`Tool::injected_arguments`][super::Tool::injected_arguments]
//! declares the keys and [`ToolRegistry::schemas`][super::ToolRegistry::schemas]
//! already projects them out of what the model sees. The enforcement side (the
//! four-step sequence above) belongs to the agent loop's tool-execution path.
