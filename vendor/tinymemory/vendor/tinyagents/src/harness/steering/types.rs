//! Type definitions for orchestrator → sub-agent steering.
//!
//! Steering is runtime control sent to an already-running agent loop. An
//! orchestrator (a parent agent, a human UI, a graph supervisor, or a test
//! harness) holds a [`SteeringHandle`] and enqueues [`SteeringCommand`]s on it;
//! the agent loop drains the handle at a safe checkpoint (before each model
//! call) and applies the commands the run's [`SteeringPolicy`] permits.
//!
//! All public items are re-exported through [`super`] so callers import from
//! `crate::harness::steering` directly. Implementations and tests live in the
//! sibling `mod.rs` and `test.rs` files.
