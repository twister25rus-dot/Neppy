//! Host budget capability: back-pressure and spend accounting around model calls.
//!
//! A host that meters model spend — token budgets, per-tenant quotas, a global
//! concurrency ceiling on in-flight completions — supplies a [`BudgetGate`].
//! The runtime consults it immediately before each model call, reports realised
//! [`Usage`](crate::harness::usage::Usage) afterwards, and asks it (cheaply,
//! synchronously) whether context should be compressed before the next call.
//!
//! **This capability is optional.** A host that does not meter spend passes
//! `None` rather than an erroring stub: absence must stay distinguishable from
//! failure, because a gate that errors teaches the loop the capability exists
//! and invites a retry. When the host supplies nothing the runtime skips the
//! calls entirely; [`UnlimitedBudgetGate`] exists for hosts and tests that want
//! a present-but-permissive gate rather than no gate at all.
//!
//! **Why a permit rather than a boolean.** [`BudgetGate::acquire`] is `async`
//! and hands back a [`Permit`] specifically so the host can *wait* for
//! capacity instead of refusing. That is back-pressure, not admission control:
//! the number of live permits is what bounds concurrency, and the permit
//! releasing on `Drop` is what makes that bound hold even when a turn unwinds
//! through an error, a cancellation, or a panic. A `-> Result<bool>` check
//! could not express any of that.
//!
//! Everything in this module other than [`Permit`] is inert (`serde` + `std`),
//! so a host can build its estimates and read its hints without depending on
//! the runtime's machinery.
