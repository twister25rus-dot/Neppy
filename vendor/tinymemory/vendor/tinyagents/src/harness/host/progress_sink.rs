//! Host capability: coarse, fire-and-forget turn progress.
//!
//! A running turn produces observable milestones — it started, it invoked a
//! tool, it streamed a token, it finished, it failed. Some hosts want to show
//! those to a human while the turn is still running; most (batch jobs, cron
//! runs, tests) do not care. [`ProgressSink`] is the seam for the ones that do.
//!
//! # When a host supplies it
//!
//! Supply a `ProgressSink` when something outside the runtime must react to a
//! turn *before* it completes: a chat UI streaming tokens, a channel bridge
//! echoing "calling `search`…", a progress bar. Hosts that only need the final
//! result should pass `None` and let the runtime skip the calls entirely.
//!
//! This is an **optional** capability. Absence is expressed by the host
//! handing the runtime `None`, never by installing a sink whose `emit` errors:
//! an erroring stub is indistinguishable from a broken sink, and the runtime
//! has no way to tell "nobody is watching" from "the watcher fell over". A
//! host that wants an explicitly inert sink can install [`NoopProgressSink`].
//!
//! # Fire-and-forget is a contract, not an implementation detail
//!
//! [`ProgressSink::emit`] returns **unit**, not `Result<()>`. That is
//! deliberate and load-bearing:
//!
//! - The runtime must never be able to fail a turn because a UI socket
//!   hung up. Progress is a side channel; the turn is the product.
//! - There is no return value to branch on, so no future refactor can
//!   accidentally make turn control flow depend on the sink.
//! - An implementation that needs to do real I/O (a socket write, a queue
//!   push) must **not** block in `emit`. Hand the event to a bounded channel
//!   and drop on backpressure. Dropping progress events is always preferable
//!   to slowing or stalling the turn that produces them.
//!
//! `emit` is nevertheless `async` (per the RFC signature) so an implementation
//! can hand off to an async channel without spawning a task per event. It is
//! still not to be awaited on the critical path in any blocking sense.
//!
//! # Why [`ProgressEvent`] stays coarse
//!
//! Five variants, and it should stay at five. A host's user-facing progress
//! model — timeline entries, cost footers, citation chips, avatars, retry
//! badges — is a **host contract** owned by that host's UI, and it is
//! *produced from* these events by host-side adapter code. It must not migrate
//! into this enum.
//!
//! The failure mode if it does is nasty: this crate is redistributed, so a
//! UI-shaped field added here becomes a compatibility surface for every
//! consumer, and the originating host's frontend starts depending on the
//! runtime to populate presentation state. That breaks in rendering — wrong
//! chip, missing footer, stale timeline row — which unit tests in *either*
//! repository will not catch, because both sides still compile and both sides
//! still pass. Keep presentation on the host side of the seam.

/// A coarse milestone in a running turn.
///
/// Every variant carries the [`RunId`] it belongs to so a host multiplexing
/// several concurrent turns onto one sink can route without keeping its own
/// side table — see [`ProgressEvent::run_id`], which is total for exactly this
/// reason.
///
/// Inert by construction: `serde` + `std` only, no engine or transport types,
/// so a host can build its own progress model against this enum without
/// depending on the rest of the crate.
///
/// **Not an audit log.** Events may be dropped under backpressure and are not
/// ordered across runs. A host that needs a durable, complete record should
/// use the harness event journal, not this.
///
/// # Relationship to `AgentEvent`
///
/// [`AgentEvent`](crate::harness::events::AgentEvent) is the authoritative,
/// fine-grained event stream, and these five variants are a deliberately coarse
/// projection of it (`Started` ← `RunStarted`, `Token` ← `ModelDelta`, and so
/// on). `AgentEvent` is the source of truth; `ProgressEvent` is derived.
///
/// Keeping it coarse is the point: this enum crosses into host UI code, and a
/// UI pinned to every internal event would break on every internal change. When
/// the wiring lands it should be **one** conversion from `AgentEvent`, not
/// parallel emission from separate call sites — two independent producers of
/// "what is happening now" will drift, and the drift shows up as a UI that
/// disagrees with the journal about what the agent did.
