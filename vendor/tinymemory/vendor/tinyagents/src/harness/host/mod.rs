//! Host capability traits — the seams a host implements to supply product
//! behaviour to a generic agent runtime.
//!
//! # Why these exist
//!
//! The agent runtime is generic over its host. It runs the loop; it does not
//! know what a memory is, whether an action is permitted, which model a role
//! should use, or what a "connected integration" means. Those are product
//! decisions, and every one of them is asked here rather than assumed.
//!
//! This is the same extension-trait pattern the crate already uses for
//! [`ChatModel`](crate::harness::model::ChatModel),
//! [`Tool`](crate::harness::tool::Tool),
//! [`ChatHistory`](crate::harness::memory::ChatHistory) and a dozen others —
//! not a new architecture. See `docs/spec/host-capability-traits-rfc.md`.
//!
//! # Required vs optional
//!
//! Four capabilities are **required**: without a context composer, a definition
//! registry, a security gate, and a model resolver there is no coherent turn to
//! run. The other six are **optional**, expressed as `Option<Arc<dyn …>>` on
//! [`HostCapabilities`].
//!
//! Optionality is deliberately modelled as *absence*, never as a default impl
//! that returns an error. A registered-but-failing capability teaches a model
//! that the capability exists and makes it retry; an absent one is simply not
//! offered. The no-op implementations shipped alongside each trait
//! ([`NoopProgressSink`], [`UnlimitedBudgetGate`], …) exist for **tests and
//! embedding**, not as a way to pretend an unconfigured host has a capability.
//!
//! # Value types are inert
//!
//! Every type in these modules is `serde` + `std` only — no tokio types, no
//! storage engines, no host types. A host can depend on this module to write an
//! adapter without pulling in the rest of the crate, which is the same
//! carve-out that lets whole domains be compiled out elsewhere.
