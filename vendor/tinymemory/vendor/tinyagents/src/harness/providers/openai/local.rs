//! Local OpenAI-compatible runtimes: identification, capability **probing**,
//! and the native-API escape hatches the OpenAI wire format cannot express.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! A local runtime is not "hosted OpenAI at a different URL". It differs in
//! three ways the transport used to paper over with hard-coded guesses:
//!
//! 1. **Its context window is tiny and not derivable from the model id.**
//!    `derive_profile` filled `max_input_tokens` from the generic hint table,
//!    which matches bare substrings — so `llama3.2:3b` on Ollama claimed
//!    128 000 tokens while Ollama's real default `num_ctx` is **2048**, roughly
//!    a 60× overstatement. Compaction fires at `window * threshold`, so it never
//!    fired and the server silently truncated the front of the prompt.
//!    LangChain refuses to guess here (ChatOllama ships no profile at all and
//!    its summarization middleware hard-fails asking for absolute counts), and
//!    an invented window is strictly worse than the `None` this crate already
//!    supports. See [`LocalProbe::max_input_tokens`].
//! 2. **Whether it accepts native `tools` is a property of the loaded model,
//!    not of "being local".** The transport hard-disabled native tools for every
//!    local runtime unconditionally, which forced the prompt-guided branch —
//!    injecting the protocol block *plus* every tool's JSON Schema into the
//!    system prompt, against that real 2048-token window, which then truncated
//!    from the front and dropped the very prompt carrying the protocol.
//!    Ollama reports this directly in `/api/show`'s `capabilities` array.
//! 3. **Some knobs have no OpenAI-wire spelling at all.** `num_ctx` and
//!    `keep_alive` are `/api/chat` fields; `POST /v1/chat/completions` drops
//!    them on the floor. See [`LocalRuntimeKind::native_root`].
//!
//! Probing is **opt-in** and never runs during construction: it costs a network
//! round trip, and a constructor that blocks on one is unusable in the contexts
//! this crate is embedded in.
