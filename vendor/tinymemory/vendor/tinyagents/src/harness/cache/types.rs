//! Cache types for the harness cache module.
//!
//! These types let the recursive runtime answer a recurring request without
//! re-contacting the provider (response cache) and keep a provider's own
//! KV-cache prefix stable across the many requests a nested run produces
//! (layout protection).
//!
//! Two distinct caching concerns are modelled here:
//!
//! 1. **Local response cache** ([`ResponseCache`], [`InMemoryResponseCache`]):
//!    a harness-side cache that lets the harness skip provider calls entirely
//!    when the identical request has already been answered.
//!
//! 2. **Provider prompt / KV-cache layout protection** ([`PromptCacheLayout`],
//!    [`CacheLayoutEvent`], [`CachePolicy`]): tooling for preserving the
//!    stable byte-level prefix that the provider will cache in its own KV
//!    store, without caching the actual response locally.
//!
//! All public types in this module are re-exported through [`super`].
