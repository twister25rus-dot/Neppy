//! Response-cache key derivation and provider prompt-cache breakpoints.

//! # Why the key is a two-tuple, not just the prompt
//!
//! A cache keyed on the prompt alone is not a cache of an *answer*, it is a
//! cache of a *question*: the same question asked of a hosted frontier model
//! and of a local 3B model has two entirely different answers, and one shared
//! [`ResponseCache`][super::ResponseCache] would serve either to the other.
//!
//! LangChain looks up on `(prompt, llm_string)` — never the prompt alone — and
//! `llm_string` serializes the whole model object (class path, model name,
//! params). This module mirrors that: [`cache_key`] hashes the request, and
//! [`scoped_cache_key`] folds in the *resolved* model's
//! [`cache_identity`][crate::harness::model::ChatModel::cache_identity] plus the
//! streaming mode and the policy namespace. The composition is deliberate — the
//! request half can be computed before model resolution and reused, while the
//! identity half is only knowable after it.

/// Produces a stable, deterministic **request-half** cache key for `request`.
///
/// The key is a 64-character lowercase SHA-256 hex string built by folding the
/// request into the hasher **incrementally**, one component at a time:
/// 1. Fold each conversation message as its own length-prefixed, canonicalized
///    frame (tag `m`), preceded by the message count.
/// 2. Fold each tool schema likewise (tag `t`), preceded by the tool count.
/// 3. Fold an **explicit allowlist projection** of the remaining
///    behaviour-affecting parameters as one envelope frame (tag `E`).
///
/// Folding per component bounds peak memory by the single largest component
/// instead of the entire request; transcripts routinely carry large tool
/// results.
///
/// # Why an allowlist, not "everything that is left"
///
/// The envelope used to be "whatever remains once `messages` and `tools` are
/// removed", which folded in fields that cannot affect what the model says:
/// [`tags`][ModelRequest::tags] (documented as propagated to events and
/// traces), [`timeout_ms`][ModelRequest::timeout_ms],
/// [`metadata`][ModelRequest::metadata] (free-form — a caller putting a run id
/// there, its natural use, got a permanent 0% hit rate with no diagnostic),
/// [`cache_policy`][ModelRequest::cache_policy] (which selects *whether* to
/// cache), [`prompt_fingerprint`][ModelRequest::prompt_fingerprint] (derived
/// from the messages already folded above), and
/// [`cache_segments`][ModelRequest::cache_segments] (pure annotation).
/// LangChain likewise keys on a deliberate projection and strips run-specific
/// message ids before hashing.
///
/// The projection destructures [`ModelRequest`] **exhaustively** (no `..`), so
/// adding a field to the request is a compile error here until someone decides
/// whether it belongs in the key. That preserves the old "no field can silently
/// drop out" guarantee without the over-inclusion.
///
/// # This is only half the key
///
/// It carries no provider or model identity — the request's `model` field is an
/// optional *hint*, and the endpoint and credentials live inside the
/// `Arc<dyn ChatModel>`. Always compose with [`scoped_cache_key`] once the model
/// has actually been resolved.
///
/// # Panics
/// Does not panic. If serialization unexpectedly fails, the affected frame
/// folds empty bytes; the key stays well-defined.
