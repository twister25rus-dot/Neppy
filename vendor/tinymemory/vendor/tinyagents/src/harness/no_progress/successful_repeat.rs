//! Successful-repeat progress detection.
//!
//! [`NoProgressTracker`] handles failing tool calls, but deliberately resets on
//! success. That leaves a second loop shape undetected: a model can repeatedly
//! emit the same response and successfully invoke the same no-op tool call.
//! This tracker owns the provider- and product-neutral streak accounting for
//! those loops; a harness middleware remains responsible for building canonical
//! signatures and deciding which polling tools are exempt.
