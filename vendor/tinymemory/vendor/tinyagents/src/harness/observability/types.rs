//! Type definitions for the durable observability layer.
//!
//! These types build on the live event vocabulary in
//! [`crate::harness::events`] to add **durability**: an envelope
//! ([`AgentObservation`]) that carries the run lineage and a timestamp so a
//! single event can be journaled, replayed, and correlated across a recursive
//! run tree; pluggable journal and status traits; and a set of
//! [`EventListener`] sinks that fan out, redact, and persist events.
//!
//! All public items here are re-exported through [`super`]. Trait
//! implementations, sink logic, and tests live in the sibling `mod.rs` and
//! `test.rs` files.
