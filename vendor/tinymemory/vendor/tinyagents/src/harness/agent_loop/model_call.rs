    /// *resolved* model's

    /// `streaming` flag, and the policy namespace via
    /// [`scoped_cache_key`][crate::harness::cache::scoped_cache_key]. All three
    /// were previously absent from the key:
    ///
    /// * the request's `model` field is never set by the loop and the endpoint
    ///   and credential live inside the `Arc<dyn ChatModel>`, so one shared
    ///   cache served a hosted harness's answer to a local one;
    /// * `streaming` is a parameter of this function, not a request field, so a
    ///   warm streaming run could be served an entry written by a unary run.

    /// can tell a replay from a real call and not re-bill it.
    ///
    /// # Failure policy
    ///
    /// A cache is an optimization. Neither a failed lookup nor a failed write
    /// fails the run: a read error degrades to a miss, and a write error is
    /// logged and dropped — the provider call has already succeeded and been
