//! Domain types for the thread-level goal.
//!
//! A **thread goal** is a single, thread-scoped "completion contract" — a
//! durable objective a graph keeps pursuing across supersteps, interrupts,
//! resumes, and budget boundaries. There is **exactly one** goal per thread,
//! with a small lifecycle and an optional token budget.
//!
//! The shape is ported from OpenHuman's `thread_goals`, re-hosted on the
//! harness [`Store`](crate::harness::store::Store) (see [`super::store`]) and
//! driven by the graph runtime rather than an out-of-band heartbeat (see
//! [`super::continuation`]).
