//! Low-level graph events and high-level stream modes — the wire vocabulary the
//! recursive executor uses to narrate its own execution.
//!
//! [`GraphEvent`] is the fine-grained, per-node/per-step lifecycle signal the
//! durable executor emits at every boundary; [`StreamMode`] is the LangGraph-
//! style selection of *which projection* of that stream a caller wants (full
//! values, per-node updates, model messages, debug detail, interrupts, or
//! custom node writes). Together they let observers — including a parent run
//! consuming a subgraph — follow a run without inspecting its internal state.
