//! TRUE end-to-end, fully OFFLINE: parallel branch execution + forking on a
//! durable [`CompiledGraph`].
//!
//! This composes the **durable graph builder/executor** (`with_parallel`),
//! the **command** model (`Command::goto` fan-out), the **reducer**
//! (concurrent partial-update merge), and the **fork identity** carried on
//! [`NodeContext`]. No model or network is involved, so this test always runs
//! and must pass, with or without `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
//!
//! Topology built by [`fanout_graph`]:
//!
//! ```text
//!            ┌──> worker-a ──┐
//!   START -> dispatch ──> worker-b ──> aggregate -> END
//!            └──> worker-c ──┘
//!            └──> worker-d ──┘
//! ```
//!
//! `dispatch` fans out to four worker branches via a single
//! `Command::goto(["worker-a", .., "worker-d"])`. Each worker contributes a
//! partial update (its produced value, the fork branch index it observed, and
//! its own name) that the reducer folds into shared channels at the superstep
//! boundary. The downstream `aggregate` node then reads the *merged* state and
//! computes a derived total, proving fan-in visibility.
