//! What the host tells this module at load time.
//!
//! # Why configuration and not a constructor argument
//!
//! A module is `dlopen`ed; there is no Rust call to pass a struct to. `TinyBus`
//! carries borrowed JSON in the host vtable and the SDK copies and deserializes
//! it during initialization, which is what [`ModuleConfig`] is deserialized
//! from. The host supplies it with `ModuleHost::set_config` before the load.
//!
//! # What is deliberately absent: credentials
//!
//! [`ModuleConfig`] has no API key, no session token, and no cloud-provider
//! credential list, and that is the central decision of this module rather than
//! an omission.
//!
//! The engine needs embeddings to recall anything, and embedding means calling
//! an inference provider that wants a key. Handing the key over would also hand
//! over the host's routing, cost accounting and BYOK policy, all of which live
//! host-side. So the key stays where it is and the *compute* is what crosses:
//! the module asks the host to embed, over the bus. See [`crate::embedding`].
//!
//! This is the same split the `tinywallet` module makes with a signing key, for
//! the same reason. As there, a loaded module shares this address space, so the
//! split is not a hard isolation boundary and is not claimed as one — it is a
//! refusal to widen what crosses a boundary that already exists.
//!
//! The Composio fields are where that line is easiest to misread, so it is drawn
//! explicitly: [`ModuleConfig::composio_mode`] and
//! [`ModuleConfig::composio_entity_id`] are *routing*, not access. The mode says
//! which branch the sync pipelines take and the entity says whose connected
//! accounts a call addresses; neither authorises anything. The direct-mode API
//! key and the backend session bearer both stay out — the first is fetched over
//! the bus per call ([`crate::composio`]), and the second is refused outright,
//! which is why backend-mode Composio sync cannot run inside this module.
//!
//! # `MemoryConfig` travels whole
//!
//! The engine's own configuration is `tinymemory_api::host::MemoryConfig`,
//! which is already `Serialize`/`Deserialize` with `#[serde(default)]`. It is
//! embedded verbatim rather than re-declared field by field, so a field added
//! upstream reaches the engine without an edit here and cannot silently drift
//! from the host's copy of the same struct.
