//! # Source scope crosses as an argument, never as ambient state
//!
//! Every scoped method above takes `scope` explicitly. In-process the engine
//! resolves it from a task-local; that task-local belongs to the *host's* task
//! and does not exist on this side of a bus call. Inferring it here would read
//! as absent, and absent means unrestricted — a source gate failing open.
//!
//! # Why the method list mirrors a trait exactly
//!
//! These are `tinymemory_api`'s [`MemoryProvider`] and all of its capability
//! traits, with the borrows replaced by owned equivalents. That
//! is deliberate: the host binds an `Arc<dyn MemoryProvider>`, so a host-side
//! client that forwards each method one-for-one is a *complete* provider with no
//! translation layer in between. Anything cleverer — batching, a combined
//! "recall and store" call — would put engine semantics on the wire, where two
//! sides could disagree about them.
//!
//! # Everything travels inline
//!
//! A `TinyBus` frame is JSON capped at 16 MiB. That is a real constraint for a
//! generated document, where a byte array costs about 3.5 bytes per byte, and it
//! is not one here: memory entries are *text*, which costs about 1.1× as JSON.
//! So there is no blob store, no chunking and no held output — the apparatus the
//! `tinydocs` module needs does not appear in this one.
//!
//! Inline does not mean unbounded, though, and the three list-returning methods
//! are not all bounded the same way:
//!
//! - `ExportPage` is paged by contract, with the caller choosing the page size.
//!   Asking for a million records in one page gets an error, correctly.
//! - `Recall` takes a `limit`, so the caller bounds the count — but not the
//!   bytes, since fifty entries each holding a large document still overflow.
//! - `List` takes **neither**. It has no limit and no cursor, so entries can
//!   accumulate across individually valid `Store` calls until the response
//!   cannot cross a frame, and the caller has no way to ask for less.
//!
//! So `List` and `Recall` are checked against [`MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`] and refuse
//! with a named `BudgetExceeded` rather than truncating. Truncating would be the
//! worse failure: with no cursor, a short list is indistinguishable from a
//! complete one, so a caller would conclude the missing entries do not exist.
//! `Namespaces` is left unchecked — it returns one small summary per namespace,
//! and a host with enough namespaces to fill 16 MiB of summaries has a different
//! problem.
//!
//! # Errors are named, and the names are the contract
//!
//! [`MemoryError`] is a rich enum, but a bus error is a name plus a string. The
//! table that maps between them lives in [`tinymemory_api::wire`] and is used by
//! **both** ends, so the module and the host cannot drift into disagreeing about
//! what a name means. See that module for why there is one name per variant
//! rather than one per outcome class.
//!
//! **No method here logs a namespace key, an entry's content, or a recall
//! query.** All three are user memory content, and a module error must not carry
//! payload values.

/// [`tinymemory_api::wire`] is the table that makes that true. `BudgetExceeded`
/// is what it means — the result exceeded a size budget — and it round-trips to
/// the host as `MemoryError::BudgetExceeded` with no client change. A new name
/// would decode to `Other` on any host older than the module, turning an
/// actionable "narrow your query" into an opaque backend failure.
