//! The engine's config loader, answered from what the module was handed.
//!
//! # Why this one is *not* a bus proxy
//!
//! Every other seam in this crate goes to the host, and the reason is always
//! the same: the host holds live state the module cannot be handed once — a
//! credential, an inference route, the user's Composio connections. This seam
//! is the one where that reasoning runs the other way.
//!
//! The module is handed [`crate::config::ModuleConfig`] at load. It is the
//! host's own configuration, already resolved by the host's loader with the
//! host's env overrides and migrations applied, already narrowed to what the
//! engine reads, and already the thing every engine call in this process runs
//! against — `provider::provider` and the queue worker pool both take their
//! [`EngineRuntimeConfig`] from it. Asking the host to re-read a config the
//! module was handed would introduce a *second* answer to a question that
//! already has one, and the interesting case is not when the two agree.
//!
//! They can disagree in both directions. `ConfigLoader::load` is documented to
//! "follow the ambient environment", so a host with more than one workspace can
//! answer for a different one than the module is bound to — and the module's
//! store, queue and summary tree are all rooted at
//! `ModuleConfig::workspace_dir`. A loader that answered from somewhere else
//! would hand a sync loop in this process a config pointing at another user's
//! workspace, which is precisely the cross-workspace leak the engine's own
//! `get_source_in` exists to avoid.
//!
//! # What this costs, stated rather than hidden
//!
//! `tinymemory_core::config_loader`'s whole purpose is *freshness*: background
//! loops re-load so a mid-session settings change takes effect on the next tick
//! rather than the next restart, and `ProviderContext::execute` re-reads on
//! every call so a `composio.mode` toggle is honoured immediately. Answering
//! from the load-time snapshot gives up exactly that. A user who changes a
//! setting after this module loaded gets the old value from anything in this
//! process until the host reloads the module.
//!
//! That is a real degradation and it is reported once per process the first
//! time anything consults this loader — `report_unserved_once`, the same
//! latch-and-report the scheduler-gate and shutdown stubs use. Closing it
//! properly means a host-pushed config signal (this module declares
//! `signals = []`), not a bus *pull*: a pull would re-introduce the two-answers
//! problem above while still being stale between ticks.
//!
//! # The gap this loader used to have, and how it was closed
//!
//! `EngineRuntimeConfig::memory_sync_interval_secs` answered the constant
//! `Some(0)`, and the contract reads `Some(0)` as **manual only**. A periodic
//! sync loop started inside this process therefore considered every source
//! manual and skipped it — silently, which is the failure class this migration
//! keeps producing.
//!
//! The fix was not for this loader to invent a better number. Guessing at a user
//! setting the module was never told is the same thing `crate::host` refuses to
//! do when it declines to synthesise a scheduler-gate policy from
//! `ModuleConfig::scheduler_gate`, and it has the same answer: guessing is worse
//! than not answering. So the *host* now sends the cadence, as
//! `ModuleConfig::memory_sync_interval_secs`, and this loader hands it back
//! along with everything else. Nothing here needed changing, which is the point
//! — the snapshot answers whatever the host put in it.
//!
//! What is left is the staleness above, and it now bites one more setting: a
//! user who changes their sync cadence, or switches Composio between backend and
//! direct mode, after this module loaded keeps the old value in this process
//! until the host reloads the module.
