//! Embeddings stay host-side; only the compute request crosses.
//!
//! # The decision this module encodes
//!
//! The engine cannot recall anything without embedding a query, and embedding
//! means calling an inference provider that wants a credential. There were two
//! ways to give the module what it needs:
//!
//! 1. put the credential in the module's configuration, or
//! 2. keep the credential in the host and let the module ask the host to embed.
//!
//! This is the second. It is the same shape as the `tinywallet` module's
//! two-call signing split, and the reasoning transfers: a credential is not the
//! only thing that would have crossed with option 1. The host's provider
//! routing, its rate limiting, its cost accounting and its BYOK policy all hang
//! off the place where embedding happens, and moving embedding into the module
//! would have quietly moved all four out of the host's control — or, worse,
//! duplicated them.
//!
//! So [`BusEmbeddingHost::resolve_api_key`] returns `None`, unconditionally and
//! by construction. There is no configuration that makes it return a key,
//! because [`crate::config::ModuleConfig`] has no field to hold one.
//!
//! A loaded module shares this address space, so this is not a hard isolation
//! boundary and is not claimed as one — a hostile module could read the host's
//! keys out of process memory regardless. It is a refusal to widen a boundary
//! that already exists, which is worth doing on its own terms and costs one
//! in-process bus round trip per embed batch.
//!
//! # Why the synchronous getters carry data instead of calling
//!
//! `EmbeddingHost` is deliberately synchronous for everything except the embed
//! itself: `ollama_base_url`, `default_cloud_embedding_model` and
//! `model_supports_dimensions` are plain getters, called from deep inside
//! retrieval and sealing call stacks. They cannot `await` a bus call, so the
//! host passes their answers as configuration at load time. Only
//! [`EmbeddingProvider::embed`] is async, and it is the only method here that
//! touches the bus.
