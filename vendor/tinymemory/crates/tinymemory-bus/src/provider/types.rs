//! Value types that exist only because the *driver contract* needs them.
//!
//! Everything here is inert data: serde-derived, dependency-light, and free of
//! any engine or host type. They are separated from [`crate::types`] because
//! that module carries the historical engine value types (which the engine
//! crate aliases back into `tinycortex::memory::types`), whereas these are new
//! shapes introduced by the provider contract itself.
//!
//! ## Why these types and not the engine's
//!
//! Several families the contract exposes (diff, entities, sources,
//! maintenance) have richer types inside the `tinycortex` engine — for example
//! `memory::diff::types::DiffResult`. Those types are *implementation* shapes:
//! they carry git commit SHAs, ledger paths, and engine-specific enums. A
//! third-party driver cannot produce them and must not be required to.
//!
//! So the contract defines the narrower shape a *caller* actually needs, with
//! wire strings deliberately identical to the engine's where they overlap
//! (`added`/`removed`/`modified`), so the embedded driver's conversion is a
//! field-for-field map rather than a translation.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately absent
//!
//! No type here names a configuration struct. `MemoryConfig` stayed engine-side
//! in the M0 carve-out and stays there: a driver holds its own configuration
//! and the contract passes only domain arguments. If a future method cannot be
//! expressed without configuration, that is a signal the family was designed
//! wrong, not that the contract should widen.
