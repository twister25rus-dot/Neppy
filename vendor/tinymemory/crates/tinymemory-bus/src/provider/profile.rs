//! The profile family: learned facets about the user.
//!
//! A driver advertising [`Capability::Profile`](crate::capabilities::Capability::Profile)
//! stores *facets* — small learned claims like a preferred verbosity, a role,
//! a tool the user reaches for — each carrying the evidence behind it, a
//! stability score, and a lifecycle state.
//!
//! # The host owns the learning; the driver owns the rows
//!
//! Which facets to extract, how to score stability, when to promote or evict —
//! all of that is host policy and stays there. This family is the persistence
//! seam beneath it: read facets, write facets, set the user's override, drop
//! what fell below a threshold.
//!
//! That split is why [`ProfileFacet`] carries a `stability` and a `state` the
//! driver never computes. It records what the host decided; it does not decide.
//!
//! # `user_state` is the user's, and outranks the score
//!
//! [`UserState::Pinned`] and [`UserState::Forgotten`] are explicit user
//! decisions. A pinned facet stays active however low its stability falls, and
//! a forgotten one stays dropped however much new evidence arrives — a user who
//! says "forget that" must not have it re-learned.
//!
//! The two are **not** symmetric under
//! `MemoryProfile::drop_facets_below`, and the asymmetry is deliberate: only
//! `Pinned` is protected from the sweep. A `Forgotten` facet is already in
//! [`FacetState::Dropped`] and is *meant* to be collected — protecting it would
//! keep the thing the user asked to forget on disk indefinitely.
