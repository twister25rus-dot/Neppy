//! The coding-sessions family: transcripts of the user's agent sessions, read
//! and distilled by the driver.
//!
//! A driver advertising
//! [`Capability::CodingSessions`](crate::capabilities::Capability::CodingSessions)
//! knows where a coding agent leaves its session transcripts, can say how much
//! is there without reading any of it into memory, and can run the distillation
//! pass that turns those transcripts into observations about the user.
//!
//! # Why this is not the source-sync family
//!
//! Both are "go and fetch, then tell me what you got", and that is where the
//! resemblance stops. A source sync walks a *remote* connection the user
//! authorised, is billed per provider action, and resumes from a cursor. This
//! walks *local* files the user's own tools wrote, is billed per inference
//! window, and resumes from a per-file state store. A driver that can do one
//! and not the other is the ordinary case rather than the exotic one — a
//! server-side driver has no `~/.claude` to read, and a driver fronting a
//! local vault has no Composio connection — so they negotiate separately.
//!
//! # Where the transcripts are is the driver's business
//!
//! No member here takes a path. Which agents are supported, where each keeps
//! its sessions, and how the environment overrides those locations are all
//! resolved driver-side. A caller passing roots would be choosing which files
//! the driver reads, which is exactly the shape a source gate exists to
//! prevent — and it would freeze the supported-agent list into the contract,
//! where adding one becomes a version bump.
