//! The source-sync family: what the driver reports about a sync it ran itself.
//!
//! A driver advertising
//! [`Capability::SourceSync`](crate::capabilities::Capability::SourceSync) does
//! not merely *accept* items a caller fetched — that is
//! [`Capability::Sources`](crate::capabilities::Capability::Sources) and the
//! sink it names. This family is the other direction: the driver holds the
//! pipelines, walks the connection itself, and answers for what the walk cost.
//!
//! # Why the two are different families
//!
//! [`Capability::Sources`](crate::capabilities::Capability::Sources) documents
//! itself as "accepting synced source items; the host still owns credentials
//! and scheduling", and that premise is still true of the sink. It stopped
//! being true of the *loop*: the periodic Composio and workspace loops now run
//! inside the module beside the queue pool, so the schedule and the credential
//! resolution are the driver's. What the caller kept is the **manual** trigger
//! — a user pressing "sync now" — which is a call it must be able to make and
//! which no member of the sink family can express.
//!
//! Folding these onto the sink instead would advertise them for every driver
//! that can accept a batch. A remote HTTP driver and the null driver both
//! accept batches and neither owns a Composio pipeline, so their callers would
//! get a registered "sync now" button that fails on first press — the
//! registered-but-failing outcome [`crate::capabilities`] exists to avoid.
//!
//! # Money is reported, never recomputed
//!
//! [`SyncAuditEntry::effective_cost_usd`] is arithmetic over fields the row
//! already carries, so it is safe here. The *price* — what a token costs — is
//! deliberately **not** here: it is asked of the driver, because the same
//! constants are what stamped `estimated_cost_usd` onto every row this module
//! hands back. A second copy of those constants in a caller becomes a second
//! price the moment either side is retuned, and the audit rows would then be
//! summed at a rate they were never written with.
//!
//! # No path leaves the driver
//!
//! [`RawArchiveCoverage`] counts pending files and does not name them. The
//! engine's own coverage scan carries absolute paths into the driver's content
//! vault; those describe the driver's storage layout, which no caller may
//! depend on and which is the one thing a bus payload should never teach it.
