//! The episodic family: the turn-by-turn record of conversations.
//!
//! A driver advertising [`Capability::Episodic`](crate::capabilities::Capability::Episodic)
//! stores every chat turn in a full-text index and groups consecutive turns
//! into *conversation segments* — a segment being a stretch of turns about one
//! thing, closed when the subject changes and then summarised and embedded.
//!
//! # Why this is a family rather than a raw connection
//!
//! It is the last thing in the host that held a live `rusqlite::Connection`.
//! The archivist hook was handed one straight out of the session factory and
//! called free functions on it, which worked only because the engine was
//! compiled into this process. A connection cannot cross a bus, so either the
//! archivist's operations become a contract family or episodic capture stays
//! behind and the engine can never leave.
//!
//! What crosses is small and already typed: insert a turn, read a session's
//! turns back, and six segment-lifecycle operations. That was the whole surface
//! the raw connection was used for — no ad-hoc SQL, no schema knowledge.
//!
//! # The host keeps the policy, and it is not a small share
//!
//! Two of the archivist's eight engine calls took no connection at all —
//! deciding *whether* a new turn starts a new segment, and composing a summary
//! when no model is available. Neither touches storage, so both stay host-side
//! in `agent::harness::archivist`, next to the recap logic and the boundary
//! thresholds they read. This family persists what the host decided; it does
//! not decide.
//!
//! # `insert_turn` returns the id, and that is load-bearing
//!
//! The old code inserted a row and then issued `SELECT last_insert_rowid()` on
//! the same connection to learn its id. That is two operations relying on a
//! *connection-local* side effect, and it is wrong the moment anything else
//! shares the connection or the two hops cross a bus — `last_insert_rowid` is
//! per-connection state, so an interleaved insert from another task yields the
//! wrong id and the turn is filed under the wrong segment.
//!
//! Returning the id from the insert removes both problems at once: one round
//! trip instead of two, and no reliance on connection-local state. The engine
//! knows the id it just wrote; nothing else has to guess.
