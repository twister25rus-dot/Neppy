//! Tests for the member-name table.
//!
//! These are pinning tests, not behavioural ones. A member name is a string
//! that only fails at runtime, in a host, as an `UnknownMethod` — so the value
//! here is in catching a typo or a duplicate at `cargo test` time in this
//! crate, before the module or a host ever sees it.
// A failed assertion in a test is a panic either way; `expect` here says what
// the invariant was. Same allowance the crate's other test modules take.
