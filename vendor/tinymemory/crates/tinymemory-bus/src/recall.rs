//! Recall filter contracts — the borrowed engine form and the owned
//! contract/wire form, kept side by side so they cannot drift.
//!
//! ## Why there are two
//!
//! [`RecallOpts`] is the historical, engine-facing shape: it borrows its string
//! filters so a hot retrieval path allocates nothing. That makes it unusable as
//! a contract type in two independent ways — it derives no serde impls, so it
//! cannot be a `POST /v1/memory/recall` request body, and its lifetime
//! parameter would have to be threaded through every `#[async_trait]` recall
//! method, which destroys the object safety the whole driver model rests on.
//!
//! [`OwnedRecallOpts`] is the answer: the same five fields, owned, serde-
//! derived. Contract and wire paths use the owned form; the engine path keeps
//! the borrowed one and converts at the boundary via
//! `RecallOpts::from(&owned)`, which is zero-copy for the string fields.
//!
//! ## Field parity is the contract
//!
//! A field added to one form and not the other is a silent contract hole: the
//! wire would accept a filter the engine never applies, or the engine would
//! offer a filter no remote driver can be told about. Two defences are in
//! place, and both must stay:
//!
//! 1. Both [`From`] impls **exhaustively destructure** their source, so adding
//!    a field to either struct without handling it fails to compile.
//! 2. `owned_and_borrowed_recall_opts_have_identical_fields` in
//!    `recall_tests.rs` round-trips a fully non-default value through both
//!    directions, so a field that is merely *dropped* during conversion fails
//!    the test.
//!
//! Both types live in this module (rather than in `types.rs`) precisely so the
//! pair is read and edited together. They are re-exported from
//! [`crate::types`], so every historical `types::RecallOpts` path — including
//! the engine crate's `tinycortex::memory::types::` alias — keeps resolving.
