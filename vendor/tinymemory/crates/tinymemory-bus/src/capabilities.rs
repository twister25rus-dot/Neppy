//! Capability families a memory driver may advertise, and the set type used to
//! negotiate them.
//!
//! ## Why capabilities exist
//!
//! A memory driver is not required to implement the whole surface. The kernel
//! asks a driver which families it supports **once**, at bind time, caches the
//! answer, and then unregisters the RPC methods and omits the agent tools that
//! belong to an unadvertised family. Absence beats a registered handler that
//! returns "not implemented": a present-but-failing method teaches a model that
//! the capability exists and makes it retry.
//!
//! Calling an unadvertised capability is therefore a *kernel* bug, not a driver
//! error. [`crate::error::MemoryError::Unsupported`] exists for the one case the
//! kernel cannot pre-empt: an out-of-process driver that answers `501` for a
//! family its handshake claimed.
//!
//! ## Mandatory families
//!
//! [`Capability::Core`], [`Capability::Recall`], and [`Capability::Portability`]
//! are mandatory. Without core and recall a driver is not a memory backend at
//! all; without portability a user cannot leave it, which makes the binding a
//! one-way door. [`Capabilities::validate`] is the single place that rule is
//! encoded — call it at bind time and refuse the bind on `Err`.
//!
//! ## Wire stability
//!
//! The set crosses the process boundary in the driver handshake
//! (`POST /v1/handshake` → `{ contract_version, driver_id, capabilities[] }`),
//! so the serialized form is a JSON **array of stable snake_case strings**, not
//! discriminant integers — inserting a variant in the middle of the enum must
//! not silently re-map an already-deployed driver's advertised set.
//! [`Capability::as_str`] is the authority for those strings and is pinned
//! against the serde derive by a test.
//!
//! ## Deliberately not `#[non_exhaustive]`
//!
//! Adding a family is a [`crate::CONTRACT_VERSION`] **minor** bump and should
//! break every exhaustive `match` in every host that filters registration by
//! family — that compile error is the mechanism which guarantees the new family
//! is actually wired somewhere. Marking this enum `#[non_exhaustive]` would
//! convert that compile-time guarantee into a silent fall-through at the crate
//! boundary (the failure mode recorded for `DataSource` during the M0
//! carve-out). If a future family must be added without breaking downstream
//! matches, bump the **major** version instead.
