//! Engine-level error type shared by ported modules that want a typed error
//! surface. Modules that mirror OpenHuman's `anyhow`-based signatures may keep
//! using `anyhow::Result`; this enum is for contracts that benefit from
//! matchable variants (validation, not-found, taint, IO).
//!
//! `?` converts `std::io::Error` and `serde_json::Error` into
//! [`MemoryError::Io`] / [`MemoryError::Serde`] automatically via the derived
//! `#[from]` impls, and any `anyhow::Error` (including one produced by `?` on
//! a foreign error type inside an `anyhow`-returning function) into
//! [`MemoryError::Other`]. The purpose-built variants ([`MemoryError::NotFound`],
//! [`MemoryError::Invalid`], [`MemoryError::BudgetExceeded`],
//! [`MemoryError::PathEscape`]) are constructed explicitly by callers that want
//! matchable, typed failure — they are never inferred from a foreign error.
//!
//! [`MemoryError::Unsupported`] is the one variant that belongs to the *driver
//! contract* rather than the engine: it is what a caller gets when a bound
//! driver does not implement the capability family a call needs. See its docs
//! for why that should be rare.
