//! Liveness state a memory driver reports about itself.
//!
//! ## Why this lives in the contract crate and not in the host
//!
//! The OpenHuman kernel has (or will have) a *generic* subsystem-agnostic
//! `DriverHealth` shared by memory, inference, channels, and sandbox. This crate
//! cannot name that type: `tinymemory-api` is the contract a third-party driver
//! compiles against, and a driver must be able to depend on it without pulling
//! in the OpenHuman host — nor should the next subsystem cut over inherit
//! generic kernel vocabulary from a *memory* crate.
//!
//! So the contract carries its own [`MemoryHealth`], and the host's memory
//! adapter converts. The conversion is deliberately trivial and lossless: this
//! is a **small closed enum with a reason string**, shaped one-for-one against
//! the kernel's `Ready | Degraded { reason } | Down { reason }`, not a
//! free-form struct that would need field-by-field mapping and would drift.
//! Keep it that way — if a driver needs to report something richer, it belongs
//! in a driver-specific status payload, not here.
//!
//! ## Wire form
//!
//! Serializes as an internally-tagged object with a stable snake_case `status`
//! discriminant, which is also the shape of the transport adapter's
//! `GET /v1/health` → `{ status, reason }` response:
//!
//! ```json
//! { "status": "ready" }
//! { "status": "degraded", "reason": "vector index rebuilding" }
//! { "status": "down", "reason": "connection refused" }
//! ```
