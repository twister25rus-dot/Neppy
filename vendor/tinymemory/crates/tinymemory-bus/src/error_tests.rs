//! Unit tests for [`super::MemoryError`], focused on the `Unsupported` variant
//! added for the driver contract. The older variants are exercised where they
//! are constructed, in the engine crate.

// A failed assertion in a test is a panic either way; `unwrap`/`expect` here say
// what the invariant was. Same allowance the repository's other test modules
// take, and the reason these files carried none before is that
// `tinymemory-api` opts into no lints at all.
