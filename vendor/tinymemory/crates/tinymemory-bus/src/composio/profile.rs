//! Who the user is on a connected account: the identifier kinds, how each one
//! is canonicalised, and what a loaded set of identities looks like.
//!
//! A provider hands back one [`ProviderUserProfile`] per connection. The engine
//! crate expands that into one facet row per identifier, so the self-identity
//! matcher can answer "is this message *from the user*?" with a
//! `(toolkit, kind, canonical value)` lookup rather than a fuzzy comparison.
//! [`IdentityKind`] is that matching axis and [`canonicalize`] is the routine
//! both sides of the comparison run.
//!
//! # Why canonicalisation is contract vocabulary
//!
//! Because equality of canonical forms is the matcher's *only* test. The value
//! is canonicalised once when a profile is persisted and again when a candidate
//! identifier is checked against it — no `COLLATE NOCASE`, no per-call
//! lowercasing. If the writer and the reader ran two different implementations
//! of that routine, the matcher would fail open: a user's own Slack messages
//! would stop being recognised as theirs, silently, with nothing to catch it.
//! Those two calls are on opposite sides of the module boundary, which is what
//! puts [`canonicalize`] here and not in the engine.
//!
//! The same argument covers [`normalize_connection_identifier`]: it produces
//! the key segment a facet row is *stored under*, so writer and reader must
//! spell it identically or a disconnect leaves rows behind and the removed
//! account keeps being treated as the user.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! Everything that touches the profile facet store: persisting a profile,
//! loading the identities back, deleting a connection's rows, and the
//! `is_self_identity` lookups. Those are the engine crate's, along with the
//! `PROFILE.md` markdown bridge, which rewrites a file in the host's workspace
//! and is host policy rather than a wire type.
