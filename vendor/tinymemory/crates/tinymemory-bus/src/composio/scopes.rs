//! How invasive an action is, and how much of that the user has agreed to.
//!
//! Composio publishes sixty-odd actions per toolkit and most of them are noise
//! for an agent's planning loop, so each provider hand-curates a slice of
//! [`CuratedTool`] entries that pares the surface down and tags every action
//! with a [`ToolScope`]. The user's [`UserScopePref`] then gates execution per
//! toolkit: reads and writes on by default, destructive and permission-changing
//! actions off until explicitly opted into.
//!
//! # Why the classification is here and the catalogs are not
//!
//! Two different consumers ask the same question from opposite sides of the
//! module boundary. The host asks it when it renders the integrations panel and
//! when it filters the agent's visible tool list; the sync pipelines ask it
//! inside the module before firing an action. Both have to reach the same
//! verdict, which makes [`ToolScope`], [`UserScopePref::allows`] and the
//! heuristic fallback [`classify_unknown`] shared vocabulary rather than either
//! side's private policy.
//!
//! The catalogs themselves — thousands of `&'static str` action slugs across
//! thirty toolkits — stay in the engine crate. They are provider data, they
//! change whenever a provider does, and nothing about them has to cross a
//! frame: what crosses is the verdict.
//!
//! Reading and writing a preference is likewise the engine crate's; this module
//! defines what a preference *is*, not where it is stored.
