//! The **host seam** — everything `tinymemory-core` needs from the application
//! that embeds it, expressed as object-safe traits plus the plain serde config
//! structs the memory subsystem owns.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! `tinymemory-core` holds the substance of a memory subsystem: the store, the
//! summary tree, the sync pipelines, ingestion, recall. Per the repository
//! README's split, the *host* keeps the RPC surface, the agent tools, the
//! security policy, the schedulers, the event bus, and config loading. That
//! split only works if the core can name what it needs from the host without
//! naming the host itself — which is what these traits are.
//!
//! # The three seams
//!
//! - [`MemoryHostConfig`] — the host's configuration, read through accessor
//!   methods rather than public fields. `tinymemory_core::Config` is the type
//!   alias `dyn MemoryHostConfig`, so code moved out of the host keeps writing
//!   `config: &Config` and the host's concrete `Config` unsize-coerces at every
//!   call site.
//! - [`EmbeddingProvider`] — text → vector. The core never builds one; the host
//!   resolves provider credentials, rate limits and routing and hands an
//!   `Arc<dyn EmbeddingProvider>` down.
//! - [`MemoryEventSink`] — the handful of domain events the memory subsystem
//!   publishes. The host implements it by publishing its own event enum onto
//!   its own bus; the core never learns that enum exists.
//!
//! # Config *sections* live here, config *loading* does not
//!
//! [`MemoryConfig`], [`MemoryTreeConfig`], [`MemorySubsystemConfig`] and friends
//! moved here from the host because the core reads their fields directly and a
//! trait accessor per field would be absurd. They are inert serde/`schemars`
//! data with no behaviour, and **their serde representation is persisted in
//! users' `config.toml`** — field names, defaults, and `#[serde(...)]`
//! attributes are a compatibility surface, not an implementation detail.
//!
//! Sections that are *not* memory-owned but that the core still reads
//! ([`LocalAiConfig`], [`cloud_providers`]) are here for the same mechanical
//! reason. They are the seam's rough edge: the honest fix is to move embedding
//! *construction* back into the host, at which point the core stops reading
//! them and they can go home.
