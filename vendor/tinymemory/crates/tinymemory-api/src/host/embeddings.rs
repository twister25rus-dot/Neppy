//! [`EmbeddingProvider`] — text → vector, supplied by the host.
//!
//! The memory subsystem embeds chunks, summaries and queries, but it does not
//! decide *how*: which provider, which credentials, which rate limit and which
//! fallback are host policy. So the core takes an `Arc<dyn EmbeddingProvider>`
//! and never constructs one.
//!
//! This trait deliberately lives in the contract crate rather than in
//! `tinymemory-core`, so that a host implementing it does not have to depend on
//! the engine. It carries nothing heavier than `async-trait` and `anyhow`.

/// Formats the canonical embedding-space signature string.
///
/// This is the **single source of truth** for the signature format. Both the
/// live-provider [`EmbeddingProvider::signature`] and any config-derived
/// signature must route through here, so a signature computed from
/// configuration is byte-identical to one computed from an instantiated
/// provider. Drift between the two silently splits one embedding space into
/// two, and every vector written on the wrong side of the split becomes
/// unsearchable without a re-embed.
/// # Delimiters in a component
///
/// A component containing `;`, `=` or `%` is percent-encoded, because without
/// that the format is ambiguous: `("a;model=b", "c")` and `("a", "b;model=c")`
/// are different embedding spaces that would otherwise produce one identical
/// key, and vectors from both would then be compared as though they came from
/// the same model.
///
/// Encoding only those three characters is what keeps this from being a
/// migration. Every provider and model identifier actually in use is
/// alphanumeric plus `-`, `_`, `.`, `/` or `:`, and each of those passes
/// through untouched — so every signature already on disk still formats to the
/// same bytes. Only a name that could have collided changes, and such a name
/// has never been written.
