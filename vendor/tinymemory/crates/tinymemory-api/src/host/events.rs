//! [`MemoryEventSink`] — the events the memory subsystem announces.
//!
//! # Why the host's event enum does not move
//!
//! The host's `DomainEvent` is a single flat enum covering agents, channels,
//! cron, tools, webhooks and the system domain as well as memory. It is the
//! host's own vocabulary; a *memory* crate must not own it, and importing it
//! would make every other subsystem's events a transitive dependency of memory.
//!
//! So the seam runs the other way. This module defines the ~15 memory-domain
//! events the extracted code emits, as a small enum of plain data. The host
//! implements [`MemoryEventSink`] by mapping each variant onto the matching
//! `DomainEvent` and publishing it on its own bus. The core publishes into the
//! sink and never learns that a bus exists.
//!
//! # Subscribing is not part of this seam
//!
//! Several extracted modules used to *subscribe* as well as publish
//! (`sync_events.rs`, `sync/composio/bus.rs`, `conversations/bus.rs`). Those are
//! host wiring by the repository README's split — event-bus subscribers belong
//! in the host, next to the registration site that installs them. They move back
//! rather than growing a subscribe method here.

/// Why an embedding model was reported unhealthy, and what took over.
