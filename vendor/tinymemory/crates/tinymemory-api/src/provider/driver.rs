//! [`MemoryProvider`] — the single trait a memory driver implements, and the
//! object the kernel binds.
//!
//! ## Self-contained on purpose
//!
//! `MemoryProvider` does **not** extend a host `Driver` trait and names no host
//! type. `tinymemory-api` is what a third-party driver compiles against, so it
//! must not drag in the OpenHuman host; and the generic subsystem vocabulary
//! (`Driver`, `DriverClass`, `SubsystemRegistry`, the policy `Guard`) belongs
//! kernel-side, where inference and channels can share it without importing a
//! *memory* crate.
//!
//! The bridge is the host's memory adapter, which implements the host `Driver`
//! for an `Arc<dyn MemoryProvider>` and converts [`MemoryHealth`] into the
//! kernel's `DriverHealth`. That conversion is trivial by construction — see
//! [`crate::health`].
//!
//! Driver **class** (embedded / external / null) is deliberately absent from
//! this trait. Class is a fact about how the host bound a driver, recorded in
//! host configuration; a driver self-reporting it would let a misconfigured
//! external backend claim to be embedded and skip the egress and trust checks
//! that class gates.
//!
//! ## The accessor form, and why not `Any`
//!
//! The kernel binds `Arc<dyn MemoryProvider>` and needs per-family access. Two
//! designs were available: downcast through [`std::any::Any`], or one
//! `Option`-returning accessor per optional family. The accessors win:
//!
//! - **No unchecked downcast.** `Any` would require the caller to name a
//!   concrete driver type, which defeats the point of binding behind a trait
//!   object, or to register type ids, which is the same table with worse
//!   ergonomics.
//! - **The capability set and the reachable surface stay provably in sync.**
//!   [`crate::provider::audit_provider`] compares [`MemoryProvider::capabilities`]
//!   against what the accessors actually return, so "advertised but not
//!   implemented" is a detectable, testable mistake instead of a runtime
//!   surprise on the first call.
//! - **[`MemoryProvider::provides`] is an exhaustive `match`** over
//!   [`Capability`], so adding a family without wiring an accessor fails to
//!   compile.
//!
//! The three mandatory families are supertraits rather than accessors, so they
//! are callable directly on the trait object and cannot be absent.
//!
//! ## Object safety
//!
//! Every method here and in every family trait is object-safe: no generic
//! parameters, no `Self` in return position, no associated constants. The
//! `#[async_trait]` attribute rewrites the `async fn`s into boxed futures,
//! which is what makes them dyn-compatible at all.
