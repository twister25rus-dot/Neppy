//! [`MemoryCodingSessions`] — distilling the user's coding-agent transcripts.
//!
//! A driver advertising
//! [`Capability::CodingSessions`](crate::capabilities::Capability::CodingSessions)
//! knows where a coding agent leaves its session transcripts, can say how much
//! is there without ingesting any of it, and can run the pass that turns those
//! transcripts into observations about the user.
//!
//! # Why not the source-sync family
//!
//! Both fetch and report, and that is the whole of the resemblance.
//! [`MemorySourceSync`](super::MemorySourceSync) walks a *remote* connection
//! the user authorised, is billed per provider action, and resumes from a
//! provider cursor. This walks *local* files the user's own tools wrote, is
//! billed per inference window, and resumes from a per-file state store. The
//! two fail independently, which is the test that decides a family: a driver
//! running server-side has no `~/.claude` to read, and a driver fronting a
//! local vault may have no authorised connection to walk. Advertising them
//! together puts a dead control in front of whichever half is absent.
//!
//! # No path crosses this contract
//!
//! Not one member takes a directory. Which agents are supported, where each
//! keeps its sessions, and how the environment overrides those locations are
//! resolved driver-side. A caller passing roots would be choosing which files
//! the driver opens — the shape a source gate exists to prevent — and would
//! freeze the supported-agent list into the contract, where adding an agent
//! becomes a version bump instead of a driver release.
//!
//! # Both members are bounded, and say when the bound bit
//!
//! A status scan caps the files it opens and the bytes it reads; an ingest
//! caps the sessions it processes. Neither is a promise to finish: a large
//! history drains across repeated calls, and
//! [`CodingSessionSource::scan_truncated`] and
//! [`CodingSessionIngestReport::budget_hit`] are how a caller knows to ask
//! again rather than to report a total it has not seen.
