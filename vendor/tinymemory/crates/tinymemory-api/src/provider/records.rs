//! The remaining optional families: [`MemoryGoals`], [`MemoryToolMemory`],
//! [`MemorySourceSink`], and [`MemoryMaintenance`].
//!
//! Goals and tool memory are small curated record sets the agent reads on
//! nearly every turn. The source sink is the seam the host's sync machinery
//! writes through. Maintenance is the seam the host's scheduler drives.
//!
//! ## The host keeps the loop; the driver runs one step
//!
//! [`MemorySourceSink`] receives already-fetched items — the host owns
//! credentials, OAuth, rate limits, and the schedule. [`MemoryMaintenance`]
//! exposes the operations the host's existing scheduler calls; no driver
//! installs a background task of its own. Both follow the same rule as the
//! engine's `queue::run_once`, and both are why a driver never needs to see
//! configuration or a keychain.
