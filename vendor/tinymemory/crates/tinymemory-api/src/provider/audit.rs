//! The honesty check: does a driver's advertised capability set match the
//! surface it actually exposes?
//!
//! [`MemoryProvider::capabilities`] is a *claim*, and the kernel acts on it —
//! it registers RPC methods and assembles agent tools from the advertised set
//! and never re-checks. A driver that advertises a family it does not implement
//! therefore produces a surface that exists in `/schema`, appears in the agent's
//! tool list, and fails on first use. That is precisely the
//! "registered-but-failing" outcome the degradation design exists to avoid.
//!
//! [`audit_provider`] compares the claim against
//! [`MemoryProvider::provides`] — which is derived from the accessors, so it
//! cannot drift from reality — and reports both directions of mismatch. Run it
//! at bind time next to [`crate::capabilities::Capabilities::validate`], and in
//! every driver's own test suite.
//!
//! The two directions mean different things:
//!
//! - **Advertised but absent** is a bug that will surface as a failing call. It
//!   should refuse the bind.
//! - **Present but unadvertised** is dead surface: the family works but the
//!   kernel unregistered it, so nothing can reach it. Usually a forgotten
//!   entry in the driver's `capabilities()` list.
