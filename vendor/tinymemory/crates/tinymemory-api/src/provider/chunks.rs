//! The chunks family: direct read access to the stored chunk tier.
//!
//! A driver advertising [`Capability::Chunks`]
//! can list and fetch individual chunks, and hand back the embedding vectors it
//! holds for them.
//!
//! # Why a caller would want this rather than recall
//!
//! [`MemoryRecall`](super::MemoryRecall) answers "what is relevant to this
//! query" and owns its own ranking. This family answers "give me the rows
//! matching these filters", which is what a host-side search tool needs when it
//! is doing the ranking itself — cosine similarity with its own MMR
//! diversification, say, or a hybrid keyword/vector blend the engine does not
//! implement.
//!
//! That makes it a deliberately lower-level surface than the rest of the
//! contract, and the honest framing is that it leaks a little of the engine's
//! storage model: chunks, source kinds, embedding signatures. The alternative
//! was worse. Without it a host either reaches around the driver into the
//! engine's own tables — which is exactly the split-brain this contract exists
//! to end — or every ranking strategy has to be pushed into the engine and
//! versioned there.
//!
//! # Embeddings are keyed by signature, and the signature must match exactly
//!
//! [`MemoryChunks::chunk_embeddings`] takes a `model_signature` and returns
//! only vectors stored under it. A caller that computes that string differently
//! from the driver gets an empty result rather than an error — the vectors are
//! there, just filed under a name the caller did not ask for. That is a real
//! failure mode with a real precedent, and it is silent; see
//! `docs/specs/2026-08-13-memory-module-port.md` §3.
