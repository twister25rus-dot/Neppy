//! Optional families that put content *into* memory and navigate it:
//! [`MemoryIngest`], [`MemoryDocuments`], and [`MemoryTree`].
//!
//! All three are optional. A driver that advertises none of them is still a
//! memory backend — it just accepts entries only through
//! [`crate::provider::MemoryCore::store`] and has no document tier and no
//! summary tree. The kernel unregisters the matching RPC methods and omits the
//! matching agent tools rather than registering handlers that fail.
//!
//! ## No configuration crosses this boundary
//!
//! Chunk sizes, embedding models, summariser prompts, seal thresholds, and
//! cascade policy are all *driver* concerns. None of them appear in these
//! signatures: the embedded driver reads them from the `MemoryConfig` it
//! already holds, and an external driver has its own. This was the sharpest
//! test of whether the M0 crate carve-out drew the line in the right place —
//! the families that looked most config-dependent turned out not to need any.
