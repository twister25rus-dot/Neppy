//! [`MemorySourceSync`] — the family for syncs the *driver* runs.
//!
//! [`crate::provider::MemorySourceSink`] is the seam a caller writes fetched
//! items through. This is the other half of the same subject and deliberately
//! not the same family: here the driver owns the pipelines, walks the
//! connection, holds the cursor and the budget, and can price what it spent.
//!
//! ## What changed, and what did not
//!
//! The contract's fifth rule — "the host owns the loop" — was written when
//! every sync was driven from outside the driver. It still holds for
//! *sealing, cascading and maintenance*, and it no longer describes source
//! sync: the periodic Composio and workspace loops run inside the module, next
//! to the queue pool, because a host that stops compiling the engine has no
//! loop left to run. What stayed with the caller is the part a loop cannot
//! provide — the **manual** trigger. A user pressing "sync now" is not a
//! schedule, and no member of the sink family can express it.
//!
//! That is why this is a family and not four more methods on
//! [`crate::provider::MemorySourceSink`]. A driver that accepts a batch is not
//! thereby a driver that can walk an OAuth connection: a remote HTTP backend
//! and [`crate::null::NullMemoryProvider`] both do the first and neither can do
//! the second. Advertising them together would put a "sync now" control in
//! front of a driver that fails on first press — the registered-but-failing
//! outcome [`crate::capabilities`] exists to avoid — and, because a new method
//! on an already-advertised family is a **major** contract bump while a new
//! family is a minor one, it would also break every existing driver.
//!
//! ## Credentials still do not cross this contract
//!
//! No signature here names a token, a key, or a session. The driver resolves
//! whatever it needs through its own host seam, at call time — which is the
//! only way that works, since a connection can be authorised in a browser
//! minutes after the driver was bound.
//!
//! ## Neither does configuration
//!
//! [`MemorySourceSync::run_connection_sync`] takes no budget arguments. The
//! per-source caps — item limits, depth windows, token and cost ceilings — live
//! in the registry the driver already reads, so passing them would be a caller
//! restating something the driver knows, with two sources of truth for a limit
//! that costs money when it is wrong.
