//! The people family: contacts, handle resolution, and closeness scoring.
//!
//! A driver advertising [`Capability::People`](crate::capabilities::Capability::People)
//! owns a store of people, the aliases each is known by, and the interactions
//! observed with them — and can rank them by how close the user is to each.
//!
//! # Why this is a family and not a widening of an existing one
//!
//! People is storage the engine owns, and it does not fit any family already
//! defined: a person is not a memory entry, not a document, and not a graph
//! entity. Adding these methods to, say, [`MemoryEntities`] would also have
//! been a **major** contract bump — the version rule treats a new method on a
//! family a driver may already advertise as breaking, because negotiation
//! cannot save a caller from a method an older driver does not implement. A new
//! family is a minor bump instead, and an older driver simply does not
//! advertise it.
//!
//! [`MemoryEntities`]: crate::provider::MemoryEntities
//!
//! # The types here are the contract's own
//!
//! None of these name an engine type. TinyCortex has its own `Person`,
//! `Handle` and `Interaction`; a second engine will have others. The adapter at
//! each engine's edge converts, which is what keeps this contract
//! engine-neutral — see the module rules in
//! [`super`].
//!
//! # Identity crosses as a string
//!
//! [`PersonRef`] is an opaque string rather than a `Uuid`. The contract does
//! not promise that every engine identifies people by UUID, and a caller must
//! not parse one out — it round-trips an id it was given and nothing more.
