//! The high-level [`Memory`] trait every storage backend implements.
//!
//! Ported from OpenHuman's `memory::traits`. Backend-specific escape hatches
//! (e.g. raw SQLite connection access) are intentionally omitted here so the
//! trait stays storage-agnostic; concrete backends expose those via their own
//! inherent methods.
//!
//! ## Contract notes
//!
//! - Every method returns `anyhow::Result<_>` rather than a typed error: this
//!   trait is a stable abstraction boundary over heterogeneous backends
//!   (SQLite, vector DB, in-memory, …), each with its own error domain, so
//!   callers should treat a returned `Err` as opaque and log/propagate it
//!   rather than match on its variant. Concrete backends document their own
//!   failure modes (e.g. IO errors, malformed persisted rows) alongside their
//!   inherent methods.
//! - None of these methods are specified to panic; a conforming implementation
//!   should convert failures (invalid input, backend errors, poisoned locks)
//!   into `Err` instead.
//! - [`Memory::store`] and [`Memory::store_with_taint`] are upserts keyed by
//!   `(namespace, key)`: calling them again with the same key replaces the
//!   prior entry rather than erroring or duplicating it.
