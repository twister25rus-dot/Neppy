//! Document format detection.

//! Intake gets a byte buffer and, if it is lucky, a filename and a MIME type.
//! None of the three is reliable on its own: browsers send
//! `application/octet-stream` for files they cannot place, a `.txt` extension
//! says nothing about what is inside, and a buffer alone cannot distinguish
//! markdown from plain text. So [`DocumentFormat::sniff`] consults all three in
//! order of trustworthiness — magic bytes first, because they are the only
