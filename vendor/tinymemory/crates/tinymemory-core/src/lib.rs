//! `tinymemory-core` — the engine-neutral memory subsystem, extracted from
//! OpenHuman's `src/openhuman/memory/`.
//!
//! This crate owns the *substance* of a memory subsystem: the SQLite/vector
//! store, the markdown summary tree, the provider sync pipelines, ingestion,
//! recall/query/search, the ingest queue, conversations, people, goals and the
//! tool-memory rules. It is host-neutral: nothing here names an OpenHuman
//! type.
//!
//! What deliberately stays in the host (see the repository README's split):
//! the RPC surface, agent tools, security policy and the taint/scope guard,
//! credentials, schedulers, the event bus, and config mapping. The host
//! supplies those through the seam traits in [`tinymemory_api::host`].

/// The host's configuration, as this crate sees it.
///
/// This is the load-bearing trick of the whole extraction. Before the move,
/// every function in this crate took `config: &crate::Config`
/// — a concrete host struct. Aliasing `Config` to the *trait object* means those
/// signatures read `config: &Config` exactly as they did before, and the host's
/// concrete `Config` unsize-coerces at each of the ~550 call sites on the other
/// side of the seam with no edit at all.
///
/// What did change inside this crate: field reads became method calls
/// (`config.workspace_dir()` → `config.workspace_dir()`), by-value `Config`
/// parameters became `Arc<Config>`, and `TestHostConfig::default()` in tests became
/// [`tinymemory_api::host::test_support::TestHostConfig`], which cannot be built
/// from a trait object.
///
/// See [`tinymemory_api::host::MemoryHostConfig`] for the accessor surface and
/// why its return types are shaped the way they are.
