//! [`ChatHost`] — chat-model *construction*, which the host owns.
//!
//! The summary-tree summariser and the memory chat helper run LLM turns. Which
//! provider answers a given role, which model id that resolves to, and what
//! credentials it uses are host routing policy — the same policy that serves
//! every other role in the application, not something a memory engine should
//! re-derive.
//!
//! # Why this trait is here and not in `tinymemory-api`
//!
//! It names `tinyagents::harness::model::ChatModel`, and the contract crate is
//! deliberately dependency-light — it must not pull in tinyagents. This crate
//! already depends on tinyagents, so it is the one place that can name both the
//! model trait and the config seam. The host implements it here.
//!
//! Reached through a process-global for the same reason as
//! [`crate::embedding_host`]; see that module for the rationale, and for why an
//! unwired host fails loudly rather than degrading.
