//! # Background Ingestion Queue
//!
//! Processes documents through the entity/relation extraction pipeline on a
//! dedicated worker thread. This ensures that `doc_put` callers never block
//! on the heavier parsing and graph-write path.
//!
//! The queue uses a bounded `tokio::sync::mpsc` channel
//! ([`DEFAULT_QUEUE_CAPACITY`]) to decouple document submission from the
//! actual extraction process. Producers call [`IngestionQueue::submit`],
//! which is non-blocking; when the buffer is full the job is dropped with a
//! warn-level log so a runaway producer cannot grow the queue without bound
//! and exhaust process memory.
