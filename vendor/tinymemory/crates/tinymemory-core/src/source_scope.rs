//! Ambient per-turn allowlist of memory-source scopes an agent may recall from.
//!
//! # Why this stayed here and did not move to `tinymemory-api`
//!
//! [`events`](crate::events) and [`sync_events`](crate::sync_events) moved into
//! the contract crate; this did not, for two independent reasons.
//!
//! It is a `tokio::task_local!`, and `tinymemory-api`'s manifest carries an
//! explicit invariant — with a `cargo tree` guard command beside it — that
//! nothing in its normal graph may pull in an async runtime. That is a promise
//! to third-party driver authors, who implement `MemoryProvider` and never
//! touch a host's per-turn allowlist.
//!
//! It also does not need to move. This task-local is the **in-process**
//! convenience default, read by
//! [`query_source`](crate::tree::retrieval::source::query_source); the
//! transport-facing form is `query_source_scoped`, which takes the scope as an
//! argument, and the bus carries it explicitly as
//! `tinymemory_api::provider::types::SourceScope`. A host driving memory
//! through the loadable module could not share a task-local with it in any
//! case — the module is a separately compiled `cdylib` with its own statics —
//! so it gathers its own ambient scope and passes it as a parameter.
//!
//! Agent profiles can restrict which memory sources a flavour recalls (the
//! `AgentProfile::memory_sources` allowlist). Threading that allowlist through
//! every memory tool and the deep `select_trees` retrieval layer would touch
//! dozens of call sites, so — mirroring [`thread_context`] — the channel sets a
//! [`tokio::task_local`] around the agent turn and the source-tree retrieval
//! reads it.
//!
//! Semantics:
//! - `None` scope (outside any [`with_source_scope`], or `with_source_scope(None, …)`)
//!   means **unrestricted** — every source tree is visible. This is the default
//!   for profile-less cron, sub-agents, the CLI, and any profile that left
//!   `memory_sources` unset.
//! - `Some(set)` restricts recall to source trees whose `scope` string is in the
//!   set. An empty set surfaces nothing (the profile selected no sources).
//!
//! The allowlist entries are matched against tree `scope` strings — the same
//! identifiers the `memory_tree_query_source` tool accepts as `source_id`.
//!
//! [`thread_context`]: crate::thread_context
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use crate::source_scope::{with_source_scope, current_source_scope};
//!
//! with_source_scope(Some(vec!["slack:#eng".into()]), async {
//!     assert!(current_source_scope().unwrap().contains("slack:#eng"));
//! }).await;
//! ```
