//! Periodic sync scheduler for the Composio domain.
//!
//! Spawned once at startup. The scheduler walks every active Composio
//! connection on a fixed tick, looks up the matching native provider,
//! and dispatches the matching tinycortex pipeline if enough time
//! has elapsed since that connection's last sync (per the provider's
//! `sync_interval_secs`).
//!
//! ## Direct mode (`[composio-direct]`)
//!
//! As of #1710 Wave 1, the scheduler is **mode-aware**: it resolves the
//! client via `create_composio_client` each tick so a direct-mode
//! user's personal Composio v3 tenant gets walked (via
//! `direct_list_connections`) instead of returning an empty list from
//! the tinyhumans tenant. The per-connection sync calls go through
//! `ProviderContext::execute` which is itself mode-aware.
//!
//! Real-time trigger webhooks (`composio:trigger` socket.io events
//! fanned out from `wss://api.tinyhumans.ai`) still do not reach the
//! core when `config.composio().mode == "direct"`, because the backend
//! HMAC-verifies the Composio webhook and pushes it down a per-user
//! socket — direct-mode users see synchronous tool execution and
//! periodic poll-based sync, but not async trigger pushes in this
//! release. See the `composio.direct_mode_triggers_gap` capability
//! entry in `about_app/catalog.rs` for the user-visible status.
//!
//! Design notes:
//!
//!   * One global tick (5min) drives every provider — we don't spawn a
//!     task per connection, because the number of connections per user
//!     is small and a single tick keeps the bookkeeping trivial.
//!   * Per-connection state (last sync timestamp) lives in a
//!     process-global `Arc<Mutex<HashMap>>` keyed by `(toolkit,
//!     connection_id)`. The map is shared with event-driven sync paths
//!     (bus subscribers, `on_connection_created`) via
//!     [`record_sync_success`] so a recent non-periodic sync prevents
//!     the scheduler from redundantly re-firing. The map is rebuilt on
//!     restart; to keep a user-configured cadence (e.g. "Sync every 24h",
//!     #3302) from re-firing on every cold start, the due-check falls back
//!     to the **persisted** sync-audit timestamp (`read_audit_log`) when
//!     the in-memory record is absent — see `persisted_since_last_sync`.
//!   * Errors are logged and swallowed; the scheduler must never panic
//!     out of its loop or periodic sync stops silently for the rest of
//!     the process lifetime.
