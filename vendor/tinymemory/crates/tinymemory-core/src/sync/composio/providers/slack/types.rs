//! Canonical types for the Composio-backed Slack provider.
//!
//! These types are independent of the Composio/Slack API payload shape.
//! They remain as compatibility wire types for product RPC responses and
//! backfill reporting; tinycortex owns runtime parsing and ingestion.
//!
//! The old `Bucket` struct (6-hour UTC window) has been removed — the
//! memory tree's L0 seal cascade handles batching after PR #1348, so
//! tinycortex owns batching and incremental persistence.
