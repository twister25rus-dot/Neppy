//! [`SchedulerGate`] — the host's background-work throttle, as the core sees it.
//!
//! The memory subsystem runs three kinds of unattended work: the ingest-queue
//! workers, the periodic Composio sync, and the workspace watcher. All three
//! must back off when the host says background AI work is not welcome right now
//! — the user turned it off, the machine is on battery, or nobody is signed in.
//!
//! That decision is host policy and it is global: the same gate throttles cron,
//! the subconscious and the agent harness. The core only asks.
//!
//! # Why the trait is here and not in `tinymemory-api`
//!
//! [`SchedulerGate::resume_notify`] hands back a `tokio::sync::Notify`, and the
//! contract crate must not depend on an async runtime. This crate already does.
//!
//! # The permit is opaque on purpose
//!
//! [`SchedulerGate::wait_for_capacity`] returns a `Box<dyn Send>` rather than
//! the host's concrete `LlmPermit`. Callers bind it and hold it for the
//! duration of the LLM-bound work; releasing it is `Drop`, which works exactly
//! the same through the box. Naming the concrete type would drag the host's
//! semaphore into the contract for no gain.
//!
//! # Unwired means "no throttling", not "blocked"
//!
//! With no gate installed — unit tests, the standalone engine build — the
//! policy reads [`Policy::Normal`] and `wait_for_capacity` returns immediately.
//! Failing closed here would deadlock every worker in every test that has not
//! wired a host up, and the gate is an optimisation, not a correctness barrier.
