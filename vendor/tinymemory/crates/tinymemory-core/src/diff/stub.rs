//! The `memory-git`-disabled surface of `memory::diff`.
//!
//! Mirrors **functions only**. The wire types stay in [`super::types`] and are
//! compiled in both directions, so — unlike the `voice` stub, which had to
//! re-declare types living inside its gated tree — there is zero type
//! duplication here and nothing that can drift.
//!
//! Only the three entry points that always-on code reaches are mirrored:
//!
//! | Caller | Function |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `memory::sources::sync` | `auto_snapshot_after_sync` |
//! | `subconscious::profiles::memory` | `diff_since_checkpoint`, `create_checkpoint` |
//!
//! Everything else in the real `ops` is reached only from inside this module's
//! own gated files, so it needs no mirror. If you add a cross-domain caller,
//! add its function here rather than `#[cfg]`-ing the call site — keeping
//! feature awareness out of always-on domains is the whole point of the stub.
//!
//! **These return `Err`, not `Ok`-with-empty.** An empty `CrossSourceDiff`
//! would say "your world did not change", which the subconscious profile would
//! faithfully act on; an error says "this build cannot tell you", which it
//! already knows how to log and skip. Failing closed matters more than being
//! quiet: the caller in `profiles/memory.rs` logs and moves on.
