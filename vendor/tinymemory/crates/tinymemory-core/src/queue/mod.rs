//! Async job pipeline for memory-tree work.
//!
//! Replaces the previous synchronous `append_leaf → cascade_seal → LLM
//! summarise` chain on the ingest hot path with a SQLite-backed job queue
//! and a worker pool. The shape is:
//!
//! ```text
//! ingest::persist
//!   └── writes chunk row (lifecycle = pending_extraction)
//!       enqueues `extract_chunk`
//!
//! worker pool (3 tasks) ──► claims jobs by kind:
//!   extract_chunk   → LLM extraction → admission decision → enqueue append_buffer
//!   append_buffer   → push to L0 → enqueue seal if gate met → enqueue topic_route
//!   seal            → seal one level → enqueue parent seal if cascading
//!   topic_route     → match topics → enqueue per-topic append_buffer
//!   digest_daily    → call tree_global::digest::end_of_day_digest
//!   flush_stale     → enqueue seals for time-stale buffers
//!
//! scheduler (1 task) ──► daily wall-clock tick:
//!   enqueues digest_daily(yesterday) + flush_stale(today)
//! ```
//!
//! All persistence lives in the same `chunks.db` as `mem_tree_chunks` so a
//! producer can insert its side-effect and its follow-up job in one tx.
//! See [`store::enqueue_tx`] for the in-tx producer entry point.
//!
//! This queue used to live under `openhuman::memory::jobs`; it now has a
//! dedicated top-level home (`openhuman::memory::queue`) because it is an
//! execution/runtime concern rather than a leaf of the memory policy API.
