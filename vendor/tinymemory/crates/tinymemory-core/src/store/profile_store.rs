//! `ProfileStore` — the only typed door onto the `user_profile` table.
//!
//! Before this type existed, `MemoryClient::profile_conn()` handed a raw
//! `Arc<Mutex<rusqlite::Connection>>` to three domains outside the memory
//! family (`agent/learning/*`, `memory/sync/composio/providers/profile.rs`),
//! two of which wrote SQL inline at the call site. Every SQL statement against
//! profile/facet rows now lives either here or in
//! [`super::namespace_store::profile`], both inside `crate`;
//! callers outside the family hold this handle and never a `Connection`.
//!
//! **This is not a guard win.** Reads and writes through this
//! type still run beneath `crate::guard::MemoryGuard`'s
//! seven policy steps: no tier check, no source-scope predicate, no taint
//! stamping, no redaction, no budget, no audit event. What changed is the shape
//! of the door — raw SQLite reachable from three domains became one typed store
//! whose confinement the compiler enforces.
