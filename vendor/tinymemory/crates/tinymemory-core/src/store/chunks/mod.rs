//! Chunks — the unit of memory_store persistence.
//!
//! One module for the full chunk lifecycle:
//!
//! - [`types`]    — `Chunk`, `Metadata`, `SourceKind`, `RawRef`,
//!   `ListChunksQuery`. The persisted shape.
//! - [`store`]    — SQLite persistence (`chunks` table + connection cache).
//! - [`semantic`] — heading- and paragraph-aware chunker used by the
//!   unified memory writer to split large documents into
//!   LLM-context-sized pieces while preserving heading
//!   context.
//!
//! The source-kind-dispatch chunker ([`chunk_markdown`], the default — chat /
//! email / document, with stable per-source sequence numbers and bounded
//! segments) is engine-owned and re-exported straight from `tinycortex`.
//! [`chunk_markdown`] and `semantic::chunk_markdown` both yield string-shaped
//! chunks; the store side decides what to do with them.
