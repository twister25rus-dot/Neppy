//! Host write policy for memory documents — the secret/PII gate that runs
//! **before** the storage driver sees a document.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! Redaction is host product policy, not persistence. Until this module
//! existed, `UnifiedMemory::upsert_document` ran the whole gate *inside* the
//! driver call: a caller handed it raw content and the SQL layer decided what
//! to scrub. `UnifiedMemory` is a candidate to move into the `tinycortex`
//! crate, and a persistence crate that owns "which substrings of a user's
//! document are secrets" is a policy decision shipped somewhere it cannot be
//! revisited per host.
//!
//! So the gate lives here and the driver methods
//! ([`UnifiedMemory::upsert_document_presanitized`] and
//! [`UnifiedMemory::upsert_document_metadata_only_presanitized`]) now take
//! already-sanitized input. This module re-declares `upsert_document` /
//! `upsert_document_metadata_only` as inherent methods on `UnifiedMemory` with
//! the **same names and signatures they always had**, so every existing caller
//! is routed through the gate without a single call-site edit — which is also
//! what makes the "no bypass" claim below checkable rather than hopeful.
//!
//! # The gate, in order
//!
//! The three steps are one ordered policy unit and were hoisted together;
//! running the redactor over a key that has not been canonicalized first would
//! scrub a different string than the one the row is addressed by.
//!
//! 1. **Reject** a namespace or key that looks like a secret. The identifier is
//!    the row's address and is echoed in logs, so a credential there is not
//!    something to redact-and-continue.
//! 2. **Canonicalize** a PII-bearing key rather than rejecting the write
//!    (#5164): rejection returned `Err` on every attempt and callers retry, so
//!    one such key produced an unthrottled error loop (3,055 Sentry events from
//!    a single user). `safety::canonical_document_key` is strict-gated so
//!    scanner-built identifiers (WhatsApp JIDs, `+1…` chat ids, timestamps)
//!    keep their identity, and the by-key read paths (`Memory::get` /
//!    `Memory::forget`) canonicalize through the same helper, so a rewritten
//!    identifier stays addressable instead of reading back as a missing row.
//! 3. **Redact** secret/PII content out of every field via
//!    `safety::sanitize_document_input`.
//!
//! Provenance `taint` is deliberately untouched by all three — sanitization is
//! content cleaning, and the taint is the signal the subconscious gate reads.
//!
//! # No bypass
//!
//! `upsert_document_presanitized` / `upsert_document_metadata_only_presanitized`
//! are `pub(crate)` and newly named, and this module holds their only call
//! sites — verify with:
//!
//! ```text
//! rg 'upsert_document(_metadata_only)?_presanitized' src/
//! ```
//!
//! Every other writer in the tree (`Memory::store_with_taint`, `MemoryClient`,
//! the ingestion queue, the RPC handlers, tests) calls the unsuffixed names and
//! is therefore gated. `write_gate_tests.rs` pins both halves: the gate
//! redacts, and the raw driver method does not.
