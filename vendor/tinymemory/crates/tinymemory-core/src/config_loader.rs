//! [`ConfigLoader`] — reading a fresh config, which only the host can do.
//!
//! [`crate::Config`] is a trait object: this crate can *read* a host config but
//! has no idea how one is produced — which file, which env overrides, which
//! migrations run on load. The background loops need a fresh one anyway, not
//! the snapshot they were spawned with: a mid-session settings change (a new
//! Composio API key, a toggled sync interval) has to take effect on the next
//! tick rather than at the next restart.
//!
//! # Two methods, and why the snapshot one matters
//!
//! [`ConfigLoader::load`] resolves the config the way startup would.
//! [`ConfigLoader::reload_snapshot`] re-reads *the same file the snapshot came
//! from*. The distinction is load-bearing: `load` follows the ambient
//! environment, so in a test process — or on a host with several workspaces —
//! it can land on a different workspace than the caller is working in. Anchor
//! to the snapshot whenever one is in hand.
//!
//! # Unwired is an error
//!
//! A loop that silently kept its stale snapshot would apply the user's settings
//! change never, and look like it was working.
