//! Memory tree — generic summary-tree engine.
//!
//! This module provides the core tree mechanics: bucket-seal cascades,
//! scoring, embedding, entity extraction, retrieval, and summarisation.
//! It is flavor-agnostic; the specific tree instances (global, topic,
//! source) and their policies live in [`crate`].

// on top of a pure move, so it is allowed here and left as follow-up.
