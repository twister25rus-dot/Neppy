# memory_tree

Generic tree mechanics on top of `memory_store::trees`. Kind-agnostic: a
`Source`, `Global`, or `Topic` tree all flow through the same code here.
Kind-specific policy (when to spawn a topic tree, what scope a global tree
covers, how digests are written) lives in `memory::tree_global` and
`memory::tree_topic`; this module is unaware of it.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`mod.rs`](mod.rs) | Re-exports the canonical contract types from `tinycortex::memory::tree` (`TreeWriteRequest`/`TreeWriteOutcome`, `TreeReadRequest`/`TreeReadHit`/`TreeReadResult`, `TreeLeafPayload`, `TreeLabelStrategy` — pure types, no IO) and the controller-schema registries hosted in `memory`. Re-exports `memory::tree_global` + `memory::tree_topic` under the legacy `memory_tree::tree_{global,topic}` paths. |
| [`tree/`](tree/) | `bucket_seal` (append leaf + cascade seal), `flush` (time-based partial seal), `registry` (kind-parameterized `get_or_create_tree` with UNIQUE-race recovery), `mod.rs` (re-exports + `memory_store::trees` shims for legacy paths). |
| [`summarise.rs`](summarise.rs) | One function: produce the next-level summary text for a bucket. Wraps the chat model with a fixed prompt and token budget. |
| [`retrieval/`](retrieval/) | Agent-facing tools. Read: `walk` (agentic), `drill_down`, `fetch_leaves`, `query_{source,global,topic}`, `search_entities`. Write: `ingest_document` (orchestrator-facing). |
| [`score/`](score/) | Product adapters over TinyCortex scoring and TinyAgents embedding models, plus entity extraction and the entity index store. |

## Layer rules

- **No tree-kind branching here.** `bucket_seal`, `flush`, `registry`,
  `summarise` all take `TreeKind` as a parameter or treat it as opaque.
- **No persistence here.** Reads and writes go through
  `memory_store::trees::{store, registry, hotness}`.
- **No policy here.** Curator gates (hotness thresholds), digest cadence,
  global scope sentinels — all live in `memory::tree_{global,topic}`.
