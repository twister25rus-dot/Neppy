//! `Config` → [`tinycortex::memory::MemoryConfig`] mapping (W1).
//!
//! The crate's [`MemoryConfig`] is the single input every engine primitive
//! takes (`workspace`, embedding dims/model/strict, tree budgets, retrieval
//! weight profile, sync budget). This adapter derives it from OpenHuman's
//! host [`Config`] plus the resolved memory workspace root, so the rest of the
//! seam constructs engine calls from real product configuration.
//!
//! Field provenance:
//! - `workspace` ← the memory workspace root (same root `MemoryClient` opens).
//! - `embedding.dim` ← `config.memory().embedding_dimensions`.
//! - `embedding.provider` ← [`effective_embedder_slug`], the slug the embedder
//!   ladder actually resolves to — **not** `config.memory().embedding_provider`.
//!   See the note on the mapping below; reading that field here would mis-key
//!   every locally-embedded row.
//! - `embedding.model` ← `config.memory().embedding_model`.
//! - `embedding.strict` ← `config.memory_tree().embedding_strict` (when false the
//!   engine tolerates an inert embedder and falls back to scope+recency rerank).
//! - `tree` / `retrieval` / `sync_budget` ← crate defaults, which already match
//!   the host engine's constants (`INPUT_TOKEN_BUDGET = 50_000`,
//!   `OUTPUT_TOKEN_BUDGET = 5_000`, `SUMMARY_FANOUT = 10`,
//!   `DEFAULT_FLUSH_AGE_SECS = 604_800`). The `tree_policy.rs` flavour overlays
//!   and per-source `WeightProfile` selection are layered on at call sites in
//!   later workstreams; this base mapping is the W1 foundation.
