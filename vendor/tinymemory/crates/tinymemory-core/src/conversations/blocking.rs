//! Async wrappers that run the conversation store's **blocking** operations on
//! tokio's blocking pool (#5156).
//!
//! Every `crate::engine::backend::conversations` entry point is synchronous, and
//! each one takes the process-global `CONVERSATION_STORE_LOCK` — a
//! `parking_lot::Mutex` — and then does fsync'd JSONL file IO while holding it.
//! Calling one directly from an `async fn` therefore parks a tokio **worker**
//! thread for the whole wait, and the wait is not short:
//!
//! * `threads.jsonl` is folded from scratch on nearly every operation
//!   (`thread_index_unlocked`), and it grows by roughly two lines per appended
//!   message and is never compacted — so the per-call fold cost grows with the
//!   user's whole history;
//! * `append_message` writes two fsync'd appends under the lock, and
//!   `update_message` reads and rewrites a thread's entire message log under it,
//!   so a live streaming turn holds the lock repeatedly;
//! * `search_cross_thread_messages` reads every thread's transcript on a cold
//!   index.
//!
//! Once more concurrent conversation operations than there are worker threads
//! are parked on that mutex, the runtime stops polling **anything** — including
//! the HTTP task that owes the client its response. That is how a create that
//! only needs one append blows the frontend's 30 s RPC budget:
//! `UnhandledRejection: Core RPC openhuman.threads_create_new timed out after
//! 30000ms` (Sentry TAURI-REACT-10, #5156).
//!
//! Moving each call onto the blocking pool keeps the lock wait off the async
//! workers. The work is just as serialized as before — the store's lock still
//! decides who writes when — but the executor stays live, so the RPC server
//! keeps answering while a slow conversation operation drains, and a queued
//! create completes as soon as the lock frees instead of after the client has
//! given up.
//!
//! Callers pass owned arguments because the closure must be `'static`.
