//! One classification and one recovery path for a corrupt chunk store.
//!
//! `SQLITE_CORRUPT` used to be handled per call site, and the sites disagreed:
//! the queue worker treated it as fatal (report once, quarantine + rebuild,
//! long backoff) while the tree-ingest paths logged it at `warn` as
//! "non-fatal" and carried on — which let a malformed `chunks.db` fail every
//! ingest for 34 minutes while the sync surfaces reported success, until the
//! job-claim path finally hit the same damage and quarantined the file
//! (openhuman#5820). This module is the single answer both kinds of site call:
//! [`is_sqlite_corrupt`] to classify, [`report_and_recover`] to escalate.
//!
//! Recovery is deliberately the queue worker's proven sequence: report to the
//! host once per corruption episode (process-wide latch), mark the tree
//! degraded so status surfaces stop reading healthy, quarantine + rebuild via
//! [`recover_corrupt_db`](crate::store::chunks::store::recover_corrupt_db),
//! and announce the outcome as a [`MemoryEvent`] so a host can tell the user
//! what happened and where the quarantined file is.
