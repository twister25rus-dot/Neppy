//! Driver admission: which ids exist, what class each binds as, and what is
//! refused.
//!
//! Exercises only the public surface of the `tinymemory` facade.
//!
//! # Selection
//!
//! Configuration now chooses the engine (§A5). One correction to the issue is
//! worth recording here, because it would otherwise have wired the wrong thing:
//! §A5 names `MemoryHostConfig::memory_provider()` as the selector, but that
//! method is a `provider:model` routing string for the memory *workload* —
//! which language model summarises — not the engine the memory lives in.
//! Selection reads `memory_driver()` instead, added for the purpose.
//!
//! What still does not exist is the last clause of §A5, that `create_memory_*`
//! return a bound `Arc<dyn MemoryProvider>`. It cannot, and the reason is
//! structural rather than unfinished: `crates/tinymemory-tinycortex` depends on
//! `tinymemory-core` since §C3, so a core factory returning a constructed
//! adapter provider would be a dependency cycle. Selection resolves the
//! *decision*; the host constructs — which is what `src/registry`'s own module
//! docs have always said.

// A failing assertion in a test *is* a panic; the crate-wide `expect_used` /
// `unwrap_used` / `panic` lints exist to keep the library from panicking, not
// the tests. Same allowance, and same reasoning, as `src/registry/test.rs`.
