//! Driver admission: deciding, from configuration alone, which memory driver a
//! host may bind and what class it binds as.
//!
//! ## Why this lives in the crate and not in the host
//!
//! Admission is the one part of binding that is genuinely engine-neutral. It
//! answers "is this driver id real, and is it allowed to answer for memory" —
//! a question with the same correct answer for every host that embeds this
//! contract. The host keeps everything downstream of the decision: constructing
//! the provider, caching it per workspace, wrapping it in a policy guard, and
//! converting [`DriverClass`] into whatever generic subsystem vocabulary the
//! host uses for its other subsystems.
//!
//! ## The two rules worth stating out loud
//!
//! **A built-in id's class is fixed.** [`DriverRegistry::builtin`] reserves
//! `null` as [`DriverClass::Null`] and `tinycortex` as
//! [`DriverClass::Embedded`], and an explicit `class` line may *confirm* a
//! reserved id's class but never override it. Without that rule, a config
//! naming `driver = "null"` with `class = "embedded"` would build the real
//! engine, advertise every family, and persist memory under the id documented
//! as `/dev/null`; the inverse would label a store-nothing provider
//! `tinycortex`. Either way the bound engine is mislabelled.
//!
//! **An unknown id is refused, not guessed.** A driver needs no per-driver
//! config entry — the embedded default's options live elsewhere — but only a
//! reserved id is admitted implicitly. Anything else is a typo, or an external
//! backend that forgot its entry, and admitting it would silently run the
//! default engine under an invented driver id.
//!
//! ## Refusal is not failure
//!
//! [`DriverRegistry::admit`] returns [`FallbackReason`] rather than an error
//! type, because the caller is expected to *fall back and stay bound*, loudly,
//! rather than leave the memory slot empty. The reason string is operator-facing
//! — logged, published, rendered in status — so it must never interpolate a
//! credential reference or an endpoint from the driver's config entry. Callers
//! pass only [`DriverEntry`], which carries neither.
