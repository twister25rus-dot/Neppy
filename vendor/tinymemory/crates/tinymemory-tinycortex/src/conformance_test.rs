//! The conformance suite, run against the TinyCortex driver.
//!
//! The last name in issue #18's acceptance criterion 5, alongside the three
//! hosted adapters covered in `tinymemory-remote`.
//!
//! # Which TinyCortex driver
//!
//! This crate binds two, and they are conformance-tested differently.
//!
//! [`crate::provider`] composes the three mandatory families over any
//! `tinycortex::memory::Memory` backend. It needs nothing but the backend, so
//! the suite runs against it here with the engine's own `InMemoryMemoryStore`.
//!
//! [`crate::engine::TinycortexProvider`] serves all twenty families, and
//! needs a `MemoryClient` — which needs the host's process-global seams
//! (`set_embedding_host` and friends) installed before it will open. A test
//! that installs a process global is order-dependent, which `AGENTS.md` rules
//! out, so it is covered in `tests/full_provider_conformance.rs`: an
//! integration target that owns the global for its whole binary.
//!
//! Running against `InMemoryMemoryStore` rather than a SQLite workspace is
//! deliberate and is also the sharper test: it is the engine's simplest
//! `Memory`, so anything the suite catches is the *adapter's* behaviour rather
//! than the storage engine's.
