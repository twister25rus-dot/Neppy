//! The conformance suite over the FULL twenty-family driver (#18 §E1/§E3).
//!
//! `conformance_test.rs` (in-lib) covers `crate::provider` — the mandatory
//! three families over any engine backend. This target covers
//! [`tinymemory_tinycortex::engine::TinycortexProvider`], which the in-lib
//! test cannot: the provider needs a `MemoryClient`, and a `MemoryClient`
//! needs the host's process-global embedding seam installed. A process global
//! makes tests order-dependent inside a shared binary, so this lives in its
//! own integration target that owns the global for its whole lifetime — the
//! arrangement the in-lib test's module doc promised.
//!
//! The seam is the same noop shape the §B5 acceptance test uses: recall
//! quality is not under test here, contract shape is.

// A panic in a test IS the failure report — same allowance the in-lib
// conformance test carries.
