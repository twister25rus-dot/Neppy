//! The configured-source registry.
//!
//! Sources are persisted as `[[memory_sources]]` entries in a TOML config file
//! (typically `config.toml`). In OpenHuman this lived on a large shared `Config`
//! struct loaded through an async RPC; TinyCortex does not own that global
//! config, so the registry here is a small self-contained reader/writer over a
//! single TOML file. Other top-level keys in the file are preserved across
//! writes — only the `memory_sources` array is rewritten.
//!
//! Every mutation follows the spec's atomic load-modify-validate-save cycle:
//! load the current file, apply the change in memory, validate, and persist.
//! Each on-disk write (`SourceRegistry::atomic_write`) is atomic (temp file +
//! rename), so a crash mid-write cannot leave a truncated `config.toml`.
//!
//! Because that rename replaces a file the *host* also writes, this registry
//! owes the host its permission contract as well as its contents: the temp file
//! is created owner-only, so a source mutation cannot hand back a config that is
//! more permissive than the one it replaced. See `create_owner_only`, which is
//! private, so this is a plain reference rather than an intra-doc link.
//!
//! The complete load-modify-save cycle is guarded by a process-wide mutation
//! lock, so separate [`SourceRegistry`] handles cannot overwrite one another's
//! in-process updates. Atomic rename protects each individual disk write.
