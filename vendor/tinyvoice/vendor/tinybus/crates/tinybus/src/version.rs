//! Peer version negotiation: who is on the bus, what they speak, what they accept.
//!
//! # The problem this solves
//!
//! Every peer on the bus is built separately. The kernel ships on its own
//! cadence; an integration is a different repository with a different release
//! schedule; a user may be running one of each from three months apart. Until
//! now the only thing tinybus said about that was "rename the interface on a
//! breaking change" — a rule with no enforcement, whose failure mode is a
//! decode error at the first call, in the *caller's* logs, blaming JSON.
//!
//! So each peer declares a [`PeerManifest`]: its own identity and version, and
//! for every interface it touches, the version it **speaks** and the range it
//! **accepts** from others. The broker holds those manifests and hands them
//! out, so a peer can find out whether it can talk to another peer *before*
//! sending anything, and can say precisely why not when it cannot.
//!
//! ```text
//! kernel                          voice service
//!   speaks  Voice 2.1.0             speaks  Voice 2.3.0
//!   accepts Voice >=2.0.0, <3.0.0   accepts Voice >=2.0.0, <3.0.0
//!                    ↓ compatible both ways ↓
//!
//! kernel                          wallet service
//!   speaks  Wallet 1.4.0            speaks  Wallet 2.0.0
//!   accepts Wallet >=1.0.0, <2.0.0  accepts Wallet >=2.0.0, <3.0.0
//!                    ↓ IncompatibleVersion, named at startup ↓
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the check is two-sided
//!
//! It would be simpler to compare one version against one range. But the two
//! peers are not symmetric in what they know: a caller can be newer than a
//! service *or* older, and only the party that is behind knows what it cannot
//! parse. Checking `a.speaks ∈ b.accepts` **and** `b.speaks ∈ a.accepts` is
//! what catches both directions; checking one catches half the skew and gives
//! false confidence about the rest.
//!
//! # Why a hand-rolled version type
//!
//! `semver` is a good crate and this is a deliberate subset of it: three
//! numbers and a half-open range. In a project whose entire purpose is removing
//! dependencies from a graph, adding one to compare three integers is the wrong
//! trade — and the subset is not a simplification of convenience, it is the
//! whole of what a range check on the bus needs. Pre-release and build metadata
//! are parsed and preserved so a version string round-trips, but they are not
//! ordered: a peer that needs to distinguish `2.0.0-rc1` from `2.0.0` is
//! describing two interfaces, not one.
