//! Detecting the things an STT model says when nobody spoke.
//!
//! Whisper-family models do not return an empty string for silence. Trained
//! largely on subtitled video, they return what such video usually ends with:
//! `[BLANK_AUDIO]`, "Thank you for watching", "Please subscribe" — or they
//! latch onto a single token and loop it. A pipeline that treats those as
//! speech will happily transcribe an empty room and hand the result to an
//! agent as an instruction.
//!
//! # Why there are two modes
//!
//! The filter cannot be equally aggressive everywhere, because the same
//! utterance means different things in different pipelines. In push-to-talk
//! dictation, a lone "okay" is almost always a noise artefact — the user held a
//! key in order to say something, and one filler word is not it. In a
//! conversation, a lone "okay" is a complete and common reply. Filtering it in
//! both places would break chat; filtering it in neither would leak artefacts
//! into dictated text.
//!
//! So [`Mode`] picks which list applies. The blank markers and the
//! subtitle phrases in `ALWAYS` are filtered in both — those are never
//! legitimate speech in either setting.

// Word counts are compared as a ratio, so they cross from `usize` into `f64`.
// An utterance long enough for that to lose precision (2^53 words) cannot exist.
