//! The bounded pool of warm workers for one language.
//!
//! Concurrency is a semaphore with one permit per worker slot. A submission
//! beyond the slots waits on it — that queueing *is* the backpressure — and a
//! submission beyond the slots plus the allowed queue depth is refused outright.
//!
//! Refusing rather than queueing without limit is the point. A host under a
//! stampede that buffered every job would trade the memory the pool saves for
//! memory spent on the queue, and would do it invisibly. A refusal is a signal
//! the host can act on, which is why [`crate::error::Error::PoolSaturated`] tells
//! callers not to fall back to spawning their own interpreter.
