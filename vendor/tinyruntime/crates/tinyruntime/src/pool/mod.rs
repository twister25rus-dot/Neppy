//! Warm interpreter processes, and the registry that keeps one set per language.
//!
//! ## Why warm workers at all
//!
//! A short-lived interpreter child costs tens of megabytes resident before it
//! runs a line of anyone's code. A host running many agents concurrently pays
//! that per execution, and it is the largest single cost in the whole path. A
//! small bounded set of warm workers turns *K concurrent jobs into K
//! interpreters* into *K concurrent jobs into a handful*, trading a little
//! queueing latency for a flat memory floor.
//!
//! ## The shape
//!
//! - [`protocol`] — the newline-delimited framing, on its own socket so a job's
//!   own output can never be mistaken for a protocol frame.
//! - [`worker`] — one warm child and the rules for trusting it.
//! - [`env`](mod@env) — the allow-listed environment and the harness on disk.
//! - `lang_pool` — the bounded pool: permits, backpressure, recycling, reaping.
//!
//! The registry below keys a pool by its launch fingerprint, so retuning the
//! pool or resolving a different toolchain transparently rebuilds it rather than
//! quietly serving from the old one.
