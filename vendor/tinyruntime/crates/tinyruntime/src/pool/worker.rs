//! One warm interpreter child.
//!
//! A worker runs exactly one job at a time; concurrency comes from the pool
//! holding several. It stays alive between jobs — that is the entire point — and
//! is retired only when it has been idle too long, has served its job budget, or
//! has failed in a way that makes its framing untrustworthy.
//!
//! ## Why the protocol has its own socket
//!
//! The job's standard input, output, and error belong to the job. If the
//! protocol shared them, a job that printed a line shaped like a response frame
//! could answer its own request, and a job that read standard input could
//! consume the next request. So the router opens a loopback listener, passes its
//! address and a fresh secret to the child, and the harness connects back. The
//! child's own stdout is drained and logged, never parsed.
