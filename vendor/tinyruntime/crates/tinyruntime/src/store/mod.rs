//! Where managed toolchains live on disk, and how one gets there safely.
//!
//! Three problems, all of them the same for every language, all of them easy to
//! get subtly wrong once per language if this module did not exist.
//!
//! **Where.** The default cache root is the user's platform cache directory, not
//! anything relative to a workspace. That is a security choice: a workspace-local
//! default would let a repository vendor a directory shaped like an installed
//! toolchain and have the reuse path pick it up as trusted. A host that sets an
//! explicit cache directory owns that decision.
//!
//! **Who wins.** Two processes sharing a cache root can decide to install the
//! same toolchain at the same moment. An exclusive file lock around the install
//! directory makes the second one wait and then find the first one's work
//! already there, rather than unpacking over it.
//!
//! **How it lands.** A toolchain is promoted with one rename, after it is fully
//! unpacked in a staging directory. A reader either sees the old install or the
//! new one, never a half-populated tree — and if the rename fails, the previous
//! install is put back.
