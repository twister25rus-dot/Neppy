//! Turning a request for a language into a toolchain that can run code.
//!
//! The order matters more than any single step, because each step exists to
//! avoid the cost of the next one:
//!
//! 1. **A resolution this process already made.** Free.
//! 2. **A compatible toolchain on the host.** One `--version` probe, and the
//!    common developer machine never downloads anything at all.
//! 3. **A managed toolchain already in the cache.** A few `stat`s, and a warm
//!    restart after a previous install costs nothing. This is the step that makes
//!    "reuse" real rather than aspirational — without it every process start pays
//!    for the network again.
//! 4. **A managed toolchain this call installs.** Hundreds of megabytes, once.
//!
//! Steps 1 to 3 never touch the network, which is what makes a non-installing
//! probe a useful thing for a host to call: it answers "is this ready?" without
//! committing anyone to a download.
