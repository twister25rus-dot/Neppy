//! Installing a managed toolchain, once, safely, and never twice at a time.
//!
//! The sequence is: ask the provider what to install, take the lock for that
//! install directory, check again whether it is already there, download, verify,
//! unpack into a staging directory, promote with one rename, and clean up.
//!
//! The second check — after the lock, before the download — is the part that is
//! easy to leave out and expensive to omit. Two processes that decide to install
//! the same toolchain at the same moment both pass the first check; the lock
//! makes the second one wait, and the re-check makes it discover the first one's
//! work instead of downloading several hundred megabytes to overwrite it.
