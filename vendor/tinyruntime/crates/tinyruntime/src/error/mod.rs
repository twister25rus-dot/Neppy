//! The crate-wide error type and result alias.
//!
//! One enum for the whole crate, with a variant per thing that can actually go
//! wrong rather than a string that callers would have to match on. The
//! distinctions here are the ones a caller acts on: a language nobody registered
//! is a configuration problem, a saturated pool is a retry-later, and a
//! post-dispatch worker failure is terminal because the job may already have had
//! its side effects.
//!
//! Messages are lowercase and carry no credential, payload, or absolute path —
//! they are rendered into a host's UI and pasted into bug reports.
