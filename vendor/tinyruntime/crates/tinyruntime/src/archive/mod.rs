//! Unpacking a toolchain archive, whatever compression the channel chose.
//!
//! Three formats cover every release channel a provider has needed so far, and a
//! provider names which one it published rather than shipping a decompressor of
//! its own. That is the whole reason this module is here instead of three times
//! over in the provider crates.
//!
//! Every toolchain archive is single-rooted: it expands into exactly one
//! directory named for the release. This module extracts into a caller-supplied
//! staging directory and returns that inner directory, so [`crate::store`] can
//! promote it into the cache with one rename.
//!
//! Extraction is CPU- and IO-bound and the underlying crates are synchronous, so
//! the real work runs on a blocking thread rather than stalling the async
//! runtime the module shares with the bus.
