//! A provider that answers from memory, for testing the router without a bus.
//!
//! The router's interesting behaviour — reuse before download, install under a
//! lock, promote atomically, keep a worker warm — is all language-agnostic, so
//! testing it should not require a second module, a release channel, or a
//! network. This stub answers the five provider questions from fields a test
//! sets, and records what it was asked.
