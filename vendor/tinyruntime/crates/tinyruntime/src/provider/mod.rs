//! What a language provider can be asked, and how the router finds one.
//!
//! [`Provider`] is the whole language-specific surface of this system: five
//! questions, none of which touch the network for bytes, unpack anything, or
//! spawn a worker. A provider that answers them correctly gets the router's
//! entire download, verification, install, reuse, and pooling pipeline for free,
//! and a provider that would like to reimplement any of that cannot.
//!
//! The trait is deliberately not tied to the bus. [`BusProvider`] is one
//! implementation — the one that routes to a sibling module — but the router
//! itself only ever sees the trait, which is what lets the resolution and
//! execution paths be tested against a provider that answers from memory instead
//! of from a release channel and a running module.
