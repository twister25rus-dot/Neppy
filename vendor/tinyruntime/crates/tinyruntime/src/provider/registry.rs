//! The routing table: which language goes to which provider.
//!
//! A flat, ordered list rather than a map, because the number of languages is
//! small, the order is what `Languages` reports, and a list keeps registration
//! order meaningful. Lookup is by normalised [`Language`], so a host that spells
//! `"NodeJS"` reaches the same provider as one that spells `"nodejs"`.
//!
//! The registry is built once at module setup from the module's configuration
//! and never mutated afterwards. Adding a language means loading another provider
//! module and naming it in that configuration — not recompiling this crate.
