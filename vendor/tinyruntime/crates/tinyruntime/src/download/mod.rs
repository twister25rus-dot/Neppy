//! Fetching an archive and proving it is the archive the channel published.

//! The digest check is not a defensive extra. These bytes become an interpreter
//! that this host then runs code with, so an archive that arrives intact but
//! wrong is the worst outcome available — worse than a failed download, which at
//! least fails loudly. Verification therefore has no opt-out, and a mismatch
//! deletes the file rather than leaving it somewhere a later run might reuse.
//!
//! The one concession: a channel that publishes no digest at all still installs,
//! because refusing would make that language unusable rather than safer. It is
//! logged at warning level every time.
