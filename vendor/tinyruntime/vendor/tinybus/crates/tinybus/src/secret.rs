//! In-memory exposure reduction for sensitive byte buffers.
//!
//! [`Secret`] is not a security boundary — see the module README at
//! `docs/modules/secret/README.md` for the honest threat model. It is a
//! best-effort reduction of the ways plaintext held in this process's own
//! address space can leak *outside* that address space: into swap, into a
//! core dump, or into crash telemetry. Anything that can already read this
//! process's memory (a debugger, `/proc/<pid>/mem`, root, or other code
//! sharing the address space) is unaffected by any of this.
//!
//! Three mechanisms, all free and dependency-free:
//!
//! 1. `mlock`/`VirtualLock` the buffer's pages on construction, so the pages
//!    are pinned in RAM and never written to a swap file or hibernation
//!    image. Best-effort: `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` is commonly a few hundred
//!    kilobytes for an unprivileged process, so this routinely fails, and a
//!    failure must never be fatal (see [`Secret::new`]).
//! 2. `madvise(MADV_DONTDUMP)` on Linux, so the pages are excluded from a
//!    core dump. A no-op everywhere else — this crate does not fake platform
//!    support it does not have.
//! 3. Zeroize on [`Drop`], via a volatile write loop the compiler cannot
//!    elide, so the plaintext does not linger in freed memory that gets
//!    reused (and possibly paged or dumped) later. This covers the buffer's
//!    full `capacity`, not just its `len` — see [`Secret::new`] for why that
//!    distinction matters.
//!
//! [`harden_process`] is a separate, opt-in, process-wide knob: it does not
//! run automatically anywhere in this crate.
