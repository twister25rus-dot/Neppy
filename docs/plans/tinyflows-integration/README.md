# tinyflows — Completion & Integration Plan (POA)

> **Status**: proposed · **Date**: 2026-07-04
> **Scope**: finish integrating the vendored `vendor/tinyflows/` workflow engine (our n8n/Zapier module) into the Rust core and the desktop UI, and close the feature gaps that separate it from a real n8n-class product.
> **Reference product**: [n8n](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n) — item-based data flow, `=`-expressions, node catalog, editable canvas, credentials, webhook/schedule triggers, executions view.

## 1. Where we are today

The integration is **not greenfield**. Three layers already exist; each is at a different maturity level.

### 1.1 Engine (`vendor/tinyflows/`, v0.3.0 — mostly done)

Host-agnostic library crate on the `tinyagents` state-graph runtime. Pipeline: `WorkflowGraph → migrate → validate → compile → engine::run`.

| Area            | State                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node kinds (12) | ✅ `trigger, agent, tool_call, http_request, code, condition, switch, merge, split_out, transform, output_parser, sub_workflow`                          |
| Routing         | ✅ linear, conditional (ports), parallel fan-out, merge fan-in barrier                                                                                   |
| Data flow       | ✅ n8n-style item arrays `{ json, binary?, paired_item? }`; `=`-expressions with **full jq** (`jaq-core`) already wired in `src/expr.rs`                 |
| Error handling  | ✅ per-node `on_error` (stop/continue/route), retry with fixed/exponential backoff, `node_timeout_secs`                                                  |
| HITL            | ✅ `requires_approval` → interrupt; in-process (`run_resumable`) and cross-process durable resume (`resume_with_checkpointer(thread_id)`)                |
| Observability   | ✅ `RunObserver` trait (`on_run_start/on_step_finish/on_run_finish`), tracing spans, journaled variants (`GraphEventJournal`) for Langfuse               |
| Persistence     | By design **none** — host injects `Checkpointer`, `StateStore`, and persists `Run`/`ExecutionStep`                                                       |
| Capabilities    | ✅ host-injected traits: `LlmProvider`, `ToolInvoker`, `HttpClient`, `CodeRunner`, `StateStore`; opaque `connection_ref` (host resolves secrets)         |
| Versioning      | ✅ `schema_version` (graph) + per-node `type_version`, `migrate()` pre-parse                                                                             |
| Triggers        | ⚠️ **declarative only** — `manual, schedule, webhook, app_event, form, execute_by_workflow, chat_message, evaluation, system`; the _host_ must fire them |

Engine-side gaps (see Phase 7): `agent` node sub-ports (chat_model/memory/tool/output_parser) stubbed; `output_parser` is identity passthrough; README/Roadmap lag the code (claim jq and retry backoff are pending when both ship).

### 1.2 Rust core seam (`src/openhuman/flows/` + `src/openhuman/flows/tinyflows/` — implemented, with holes)

- **Domain** `flows::` (~3,700 lines + tests): `types.rs` (`Flow` wraps `WorkflowGraph` + `enabled`/`require_approval`/`last_status`; `FlowRun`, `FlowRunStep`, `FlowRunTrigger::{Rpc,Schedule,AppEvent,Resume}`), `store.rs` (SQLite incl. `flow_state` kv), `ops.rs` (validate/migrate + full run/resume under `TrustedAutomation → Workflow` origin, 600 s timeout), `schemas.rs`, `tools.rs` (`ProposeWorkflowTool` — validate-only, never persists), `bus.rs` (`FlowTriggerSubscriber`).
- **RPC surface** (10 methods, wired in `src/core/all.rs`): `openhuman.flows_{create,get,list,update,delete,set_enabled,run,resume,list_runs,get_run}`.
- **Capability seam** `src/openhuman/flows/tinyflows/`: `caps.rs` (LLM/Composio-tools/HTTP/code/state adapters), `observability.rs` (currently `NoopObserver`), `langfuse_export.rs` (post-run trace export).
- **Schedule triggers work end-to-end**: `flows::ops::bind_schedule_trigger` registers a cron `JobType::Flow` → scheduler publishes `DomainEvent::FlowScheduleTick` → `FlowTriggerSubscriber` runs the flow.
- **Composio `app_event` triggers also work end-to-end**: `flows/bus.rs::handle_app_event` matches `DomainEvent::ComposioTriggerReceived { toolkit, trigger }` against enabled `app_event` flows (case-insensitive toolkit/slug match, per-flow concurrency guard) and runs them under `FlowRunTrigger::AppEvent`. Since Composio triggers are delivered by the platform, this **is** our webhook story for third-party apps — no tunnel needed.

**Known core gaps** (each becomes a workstream below):

| #   | Gap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Evidence                                                                    |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| G1  | **Raw `webhook` triggers unwired** (mitigated: Composio `app_event` triggers already cover third-party apps) — enabling a webhook-trigger flow only logs a warning; `bus.rs` observes `WebhookIncomingRequest` but explicitly does not dispatch; Composio trigger *subscriptions* are not auto-provisioned on enable                                                                                               | `flows/ops.rs:298` (`log_webhook_trigger_deferred`), `flows/bus.rs:232-242` |
| G2  | **No live run observer** — `NoopObserver`; `FlowRunStep`s reconstructed post-hoc from final state, no per-step timing/attempts, nothing streamed while running                                                                                                | `flows/types.rs:76`, `flows/ops.rs:781-783` (`TODO(0.3)`)                   |
| G3  | **Credential / connected-account resolution stubbed** — Composio nodes fall back to the ambient signed-in account; toolkit allow-listing hard-rejects real toolkits; HTTP credential resolution unimplemented (`connection_ref` is accepted but unresolvable) | `tinyflows/caps.rs:193,235-261,330,376,408`                                 |
| G4  | **No cancel/deny** — a dismissed approval leaves the run parked `pending_approval` forever; no `flows_cancel`/`flows_deny` RPC                                                                                                                                | UI comment in `FlowApprovalCard.tsx`                                        |
| G5  | **No JSON-RPC E2E coverage** — zero `openhuman.flows_*` calls in `tests/json_rpc_e2e.rs` (unit tests only)                                                                                                                                                    | grep of `tests/*.rs`                                                        |
| G6  | Unfired trigger kinds: `chat_message`, `form`, `execute_by_workflow` (as a _trigger_), `evaluation`, `system` have no host dispatcher                                                                                                                         | `flows/bus.rs`                                                              |

### 1.3 Frontend (`app/src/` — reachable, read-only)

Shipped: `/flows` nav tab (FlowsPage list: enable toggle, Run, last status), `/flows/:id` **read-only** canvas (`@xyflow/react` v12, custom nodes, minimap), `FlowRunsDrawer` + `FlowRunInspectorDrawer` (2 s polling via `useFlowRunPoller`), chat `WorkflowProposalCard` (agent `propose_workflow` → user "Save & enable" is the **only** creation path), `FlowApprovalCard` HITL notifications. All components have co-located Vitest coverage; i18n namespaces `flows.*`/`flowRuns.*`/`notifications.flow.*` exist across locales.

**Known UI gaps**:

| #   | Gap                                                                                                                                                                      | Evidence                                 |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| U1  | **No canvas editing** — `nodesDraggable/Connectable/elementsSelectable: false`; `xyflowToWorkflowGraph` in `graphAdapter.ts` is dead code awaiting the editor ("B5b.2+") | `components/flows/canvas/FlowCanvas.tsx` |
| U2  | **No node config panel** — clicking a node does nothing; `config` shown only as truncated hint chips                                                                     | —                                        |
| U3  | **No authoring entry** — "New workflow" navigates to `/chat` with a TODO; empty-state copy promises canvas creation that doesn't exist                                   | `pages/FlowsPage.tsx`                    |
| U4  | No trigger-config UI, no credentials picker, no template gallery, no import/export                                                                                       | —                                        |

| U6  | Run progress is poll-only; no socket push (blocked on G2)                                                                                                                | `hooks/useFlowRunPoller.ts`              |

### 1.4 Disambiguation (do not conflate)

The repo has **three** "workflow" systems. This plan touches only the first:

1. `flows::` / `openhuman.flows_*` — **tinyflows typed graphs** (this plan).
2. `workflows::` / `openhuman.workflows_*` — WORKFLOW.md/SKILL.md bundle discovery/install (separate product surface under `/skills`). **Slated for decommission** — it is essentially the skills feature wearing the "workflows" name; see Phase 8. Retiring it frees the "Workflows" branding for tinyflows (the `/flows` nav tab already reads "Workflows").
3. `rhai::` — Rhai `.ragsh` language workflows (`docs/plans/rlm-workflows/`), positioned in `gitbooks/features/orchestration.md` as the _next_ layer on the same substrate. tinyflows remains the shipping visual/typed product; Rhai workflows do not replace it.

## 2. Gap analysis vs n8n / Zapier

What an n8n user would expect, mapped to our state:

| n8n capability                                        | tinyflows/OpenHuman today                                                    | Covered by        |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |

| App-event trigger (≈ Zapier polling/instant triggers) | Wired via Composio `ComposioTriggerReceived`, but account resolution stubbed | Phase 1 (G3)      |
| Credentials store + per-node credential picker        | `connection_ref` plumbing exists; resolution unimplemented; no UI            | Phase 2           |
| Executions list + live run view                       | List + inspector exist; polling, post-hoc steps only                         | Phase 1–2         |

| Error workflow / retry per node                       | ✅ on_error/retry/backoff                                                    | —                 |

| Templates gallery                                     | Missing                                                                      | Phase 4           |
| Import/export workflow JSON, n8n import               | Missing (feasible: model is deliberately n8n-shaped)                         | Phase 4           |
| Partial execution / pin data / step-through debug     | Missing                                                                      | Phase 5 (stretch) |

| Versioning of workflow definitions                    | ✅ schema_version + type_version + migrate                                   | —                 |
| Multi-user sharing/RBAC                               | Out of scope (desktop, single-user + team domain later)                      | —                 |

Our structural advantages to preserve: the agent can _author_ workflows conversationally (`propose_workflow` → proposal card → single human "Save & enable" persistence gate), everything runs under the security policy/approval-gate substrate, and secrets never enter the engine (opaque `connection_ref`).

---

## 3. Plan of action

Ordering rationale: **backend correctness first** (triggers, cancellation, live observation, credentials) because every UI phase consumes those RPCs; the editable canvas is the largest UI lift and is independent of trigger work, so it proceeds in parallel from Phase 3.

### Phase 0 — Substrate hygiene: tinyagents pin & tags

Every workflow is, at run time, a **unique tinyagents state graph**: `compile()` wraps the `WorkflowGraph`, and the engine lowers it per run into a tinyagents graph (nodes → graph nodes, output ports → conditional edges, fan-in → waiting edges); run state (`MergeReducer` over a single JSON value), durable checkpointing, HITL interrupts, and the event journal are all tinyagents primitives, keyed per run by `thread_id`/`run_id`. So the health of the tinyagents pin is the health of the whole feature.

Audit (2026-07-04):

- ✅ **Single unified copy** — both Cargo worlds (`Cargo.toml:355`, `app/src-tauri/Cargo.toml:214`) patch `tinyagents` to `vendor/tinyagents`; exactly one `tinyagents 1.5.0` in both lockfiles. tinyflows' `tinyagents = "1.2"` requirement unifies onto the same copy (semver-compatible). No duplication, no type-identity risk.
- ⚠️ **Not on a tag** — the submodule is pinned at `df391c4` = `v1.5.0-13-gdf391c4`: 13 untagged commits past v1.5.0 (REPL host-embedding / cancel work taken early for the Rhai workflow feature). The crate still self-reports `1.5.0`, so the version string understates the vendored code.
- ⚠️ **Two minor versions behind** — upstream is at **v1.7.1** (60 commits past v1.5.0). The 13 early-adopted commits all landed upstream (via PR #19 etc.; `ReplSession::set_cancel_flag` verified present in v1.7.1), so retagging loses nothing.
- ⚠️ Same pattern on tinyflows itself: submodule at `v0.3.0-1-g438f8fc` (one commit past tag).

Work items:

1. Bump `vendor/tinyagents` submodule to the **v1.7.1 tag**; bump root requirement `tinyagents = { version = "1.7", features = ["sqlite", "repl"] }` (verify both features still exist in 1.7); `cargo update -p tinyagents` in both lockfiles.
2. Review the v1.5→v1.7 changelog for API breaks in the seams we touch: `Checkpointer`/`DurabilityMode`, `GraphEventJournal`/`GraphObservation`, interrupt/resume semantics (used by `flows::ops` + `src/openhuman/agent/tinyagents/` + Rhai workflows).
3. Retag `vendor/tinyflows` on a proper release (v0.3.1) whose `Cargo.toml` requires `tinyagents = "1.7"` so the version story is coherent end-to-end.
4. Gate with `cargo check` both worlds, `pnpm test:rust`, and the flows/Rhai unit suites; adopt a standing rule: **vendored tiny\* submodules pin release tags, never floating commits** (early-adopting an upstream PR requires a pre-release tag).

### Phase 1 — Backend completion (triggers, lifecycle, observability)

**1a. External event triggers — Composio-first (G1).**

Product decision: **Composio triggers are the webhook story.** `app_event` dispatch already works end-to-end (see §1.2) and the platform handles inbound delivery, auth, and NAT traversal — so we do *not* build our own tunnel/webhook infrastructure for third-party app events. Remaining work is lifecycle and coverage, not plumbing:

- **Trigger subscription lifecycle**: enabling an `app_event` flow should ensure the corresponding Composio trigger subscription exists upstream (create on `set_enabled(true)` via the `composio` domain, tear down on disable/delete when no other flow uses it) instead of assuming the user pre-configured it in Composio. Reconcile at boot like `bind_schedule_trigger` does.
- **Payload hygiene**: trigger payloads are untrusted input — route through `prompt_injection` screening before any `agent` node consumes them (applies to all external-event runs).
- **Trigger catalog surfacing**: expose the Composio trigger catalog (toolkit → available trigger slugs + payload schemas) over RPC so the UI (Phase 3 trigger config) and the builder agent (Phase 5 `search_tool_catalog`) offer real, connectable events instead of free-text slugs.
- **Raw `webhook` trigger kind → demoted**: for arbitrary custom HTTP callers not covered by a Composio toolkit, keep the `webhook` kind but defer implementation (generic inbound via `webhooks::ops`/`create_tunnel` stays a backlog item). Until then, validation must **warn loudly** at save/enable time that a `webhook`-trigger flow will not fire, instead of today's silent log line (`flows/ops.rs:298`).

**1b. Run lifecycle: cancel + deny (G4).**

- New RPCs `openhuman.flows_cancel_run(run_id)` (terminal `cancelled` status; abort the tokio task / drop the checkpointed thread) and deny semantics on resume: `flows_resume(id, thread_id, approvals, rejections)` → rejected node routes to its `error` port or fails the run.
- Sweep: TTL for parked `pending_approval` runs (align with the 10-min approval-gate TTL, configurable per flow).

**1c. Live run observation (G2).**

- Implement a real `RunObserver` in `src/openhuman/flows/tinyflows/observability.rs`: `on_step_finish` → persist `FlowRunStep` incrementally (timing, attempt count, status, output) via `flows::store`, and publish a new `DomainEvent::FlowRunProgress { run_id, node_id, status }`.
- Bridge to the frontend socket (`socket` domain) so the inspector can subscribe instead of polling (UI lands in Phase 2/3; keep polling as fallback).
- Wire the journaled run variants so Langfuse export happens per-step, not only post-run.

**1d. Remaining trigger kinds (G6).**

Full taxonomy, the generic event-dispatcher design, and the **cron → workflows migration** live in the companion doc **[triggers.md](triggers.md)**. Summary:

- `form` + one-shot/interval schedule sugar first (cheap wins).
- A **trigger catalog** (curated allowlist of `DomainEvent`s with stable payload schemas + jq filters) feeding one generic `system`-kind dispatcher in `FlowTriggerSubscriber` — instead of a bespoke handler per event. Guardrails: loop prevention via run provenance depth, per-flow rate limits, payload hygiene/risk classes.
- `chat_message` from the channels pipeline (untrusted-input guardrails required first).
- **Cron unification**: legacy `JobType::Shell`/`Agent` cron jobs become one-node scheduled flows (dual-write bridge, then backfill migration); cron remains only as the internal tick engine. "Everything automated is a workflow."
- Until a kind's dispatcher ships, validation warns loudly at save/enable instead of silently never firing.

**1e. E2E tests (G5).**

- Extend `tests/json_rpc_e2e.rs` (+ `scripts/test-rust-with-mock.sh`): full lifecycle round-trip (create → run → steps → resume → cancel → delete), schedule-tick dispatch, webhook dispatch, approval park/deny. This is the merge gate for 1a–1d.

**Deliverable**: every trigger kind either fires or loudly warns; runs can be cancelled/denied; run steps stream.

### Phase 2 — Credentials & connections (G3)

The `connection_ref` seam exists end-to-end but resolves nothing. This phase makes integration nodes real.

- **Composio connected accounts**: resolve `connection_ref` → specific Composio connected account (today: ambient-account fallback). Fix toolkit allow-listing in `caps.rs:193` so real toolkits pass policy instead of being hard-rejected. Surface account choice in the node config (`connection_ref` = connected-account id).
- **HTTP credentials**: back `connection_ref` for `http_request` nodes with the existing `credentials` domain (header/bearer/basic templates stored encrypted; injected server-side in `OpenHumanHttp::request` — never returned to the UI or the engine).
- **RPCs**: `flows_list_connections()` (aggregate Composio connected accounts + stored HTTP credentials, ids + display names only) for the UI picker.
- **Policy**: `code` and `http_request` node execution must respect the `[autonomy]` tier / `classify_command`-equivalent gating (network class); document the matrix in `flows/ops.rs`.

**Deliverable**: an `http_request` or Composio `tool_call` node can be pointed at a chosen account/credential by reference, with secrets never leaving the core.

### Phase 3 — Editable canvas (U1–U2) — the n8n builder

Largest UI phase; runs in parallel with Phase 2 once Phase 1c's RPCs exist.

- **3a. Edit mode in `FlowCanvas`**: flip the readonly defaults behind an `editable` prop; enable drag (persist `position`), connect (port-aware: derive valid source/target handles from node kind — reuse `graphAdapter` port logic), delete nodes/edges, and a node palette (12 kinds with the existing emoji/accent metadata). Wire the already-written `xyflowToWorkflowGraph` as the save path → `flows_update`.
- **3b. Node config panel**: right-hand drawer on node select. v1 pragmatic approach: per-kind form components for the high-traffic kinds (`trigger` schedule/webhook config, `http_request` method/url/headers/body, `agent` prompt/model, `tool_call` slug/args, `condition`/`switch` expression, `transform` set-map, `code` editor with language toggle) + a raw-JSON escape hatch for the rest. `=`-expression fields get a monospace input with an "expression" affordance (full expression-editor with live preview is a stretch goal — needs a `flows_eval_expr` RPC against sample run data).
- **3c. Validation UX**: new RPC `openhuman.flows_validate(graph)` (thin wrapper over `ops::validate_and_migrate_graph`, same path `propose_workflow` uses) → inline canvas errors (missing trigger, cycle, invalid config on node X) before save.
- **3d. Draft/dirty state**: local draft in component state; explicit Save; unsaved-changes guard. No autosave in v1 (a saved+enabled flow is live — accidental saves fire schedules).
- **3e. Live run overlay**: subscribe to `FlowRunProgress` socket events; animate node status on the canvas during a run (n8n's signature interaction) and in the inspector.

**Deliverable**: create/edit a workflow entirely on the canvas; watch it execute live.

### Phase 4 — Authoring entry points, templates, interop (U3–U4)

- **4a. "New workflow"**: replace the `/chat` TODO with a chooser — _Start from scratch_ (blank canvas with a trigger node), _Describe it_ (interim: prefill chat composer → `propose_workflow`; superseded by the Phase 5 in-place prompt bar), _From template_.
- **4b. Sub-workflow by id**: extend `sub_workflow`/`execute_by_workflow` to reference a saved `flow_id` (engine currently only inlines a child graph) — engine change upstreamed to `vendor/tinyflows` + host resolver in `caps`/ops.
- **4c. Templates**: ship 5–10 curated `WorkflowGraph` JSONs (bundled resources, like agent prompts): e.g. "Daily digest to channel", "Webhook → agent triage → notify", "Scheduled scrape → transform → memory". Gallery UI on FlowsPage empty state.
- **4d. Import/export**: export flow JSON; import with `migrate()` + validate. **n8n importer** (host-side, best-effort): map n8n workflow JSON → `WorkflowGraph` for the overlapping vocabulary (IF→condition, Switch, Merge, SplitOut, HTTP Request, Code, Schedule/Webhook triggers; `={{...}}` → `=` jq where trivially translatable); unmapped nodes land as annotated placeholder nodes rather than failing the import.
- **4e. Proposal card upgrade**: "Open in canvas" action on `WorkflowProposalCard` (review/edit before Save & enable) — keeps the single persistence gate.

### Phase 5 — Prompt-first authoring: the Workflow Builder agent

The product stance ("the agent builds it, you approve it") gets a first-class surface: users prompt **from the Workflows UI itself** — not by wandering into `/chat` — and a dedicated, tool-scoped agent designs and iterates on the graph in place. This is the differentiator over n8n, so it deserves its own phase rather than being a bullet under 4a.

**5a. A dedicated `workflow-builder` agent definition.**

The harness already supports exactly this shape: `AgentDefinition` (`src/openhuman/agent/harness/definition.rs`) with `ToolScope::Named`, registered as a builtin in `harness/builtin_definitions.rs` and overridable by user TOML via `definition_loader.rs`.

- New builtin definition `workflow-builder` (Worker tier): system prompt specialized for workflow design — knows the 12 node kinds, `=`/jq expression semantics, port/edge rules, trigger kinds and which ones are live, error-handling config (`on_error`/`retry`), and the "propose, never persist" invariant. Prompt ships in `src/openhuman/agent/prompts/` like the other bundled prompts.
- `ToolScope::Named` — deliberately narrow toolset (see 5b): no shell, no file writes, no channel sends. `external_effect = false` end-to-end; the only side effects it can cause are validated *proposals*.
- Reachable two ways: (1) directly from the Flows UI prompt surface (5c), spawned with the flow/draft as context; (2) by delegation from the main agent via the existing delegation tools (`agent/tools/delegate_to_personality.rs`, archetype/skill delegation in `agent_orchestration::tools`) so "set up a workflow that…" in normal chat routes to the specialist automatically.

**5b. The builder's tool belt** (new tools live in `flows/tools.rs` per the tool-ownership rule, registered in `tools/ops.rs`):

| Tool | Status | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `propose_workflow` | ✅ exists | Validate a full graph + emit proposal payload (unchanged invariant: never persists) |
| `revise_workflow` | new | Take the current draft graph + an instruction diff → emit an updated proposal; enables iterative refinement instead of regenerate-from-scratch |
| `list_workflows` / `get_workflow` | new (read-only) | Inspect existing flows so the agent can reference, clone, or avoid duplicating them |
| `get_workflow_run` | new (read-only) | Read a failed run's steps so the agent can debug/repair a workflow from an error report |
| `list_flow_connections` | new | Enumerate Composio connected accounts + stored HTTP credentials (ids/names only — Phase 2's RPC surfaced as a tool) so generated nodes carry valid `connection_ref`s |
| `search_tool_catalog` | new | Search the Composio/tools registry for real tool slugs, so `tool_call` nodes are grounded in tools that actually exist (today the agent can hallucinate slugs) |
| `dry_run_workflow` | new | Execute the *draft* graph against mock/sandboxed capabilities (`tinyflows` `mock` feature or capped real caps with `requires_approval` forced on) and return step results — lets the agent self-verify before proposing |

All read-only tools return `PermissionLevel::None`; `dry_run_workflow` is gated by autonomy tier since `code`/`http_request` nodes could execute.

**5c. Prompt surface in the Flows UI.**

- **FlowsPage prompt bar**: a "Describe a workflow…" composer at the top of `/flows` (and as the empty-state hero). Submitting spawns a `workflow-builder` turn in a dedicated thread; the resulting proposal renders inline (reuse `WorkflowProposalCard`) with **Open in canvas** and **Save & enable**.
- **Canvas copilot panel**: on `/flows/:id` (and on drafts), a side panel chat bound to the same agent with the current graph injected as context. Each agent proposal updates a **draft overlay** on the canvas (diff-style: added nodes highlighted, removed ones ghosted) — accept/reject applies it to the local draft from Phase 3d. This is `revise_workflow` in a loop: "add a Slack notification on failure", "make the schedule weekdays only", "split this into a sub-workflow".
- **Repair entry point**: from a failed run in `FlowRunInspectorDrawer`, "Fix with agent" opens the copilot with the run's failing step context preloaded (`get_workflow_run`).
- Plumbing reuses the existing chat runtime (`ChatRuntimeProvider` already parses `propose_workflow` outputs into `pendingWorkflowProposalsByThread`); the new work is thread scoping per draft/flow, the canvas diff overlay, and routing turns to the `workflow-builder` definition instead of the main agent.

**5d. Invariants** (carry over from the current design, enforced in review):

- The agent **never persists or enables** a flow — `flows_create`/`flows_update`/`set_enabled` remain UI-only actions behind an explicit user click.
- Proposals are always re-validated server-side at save time (`flows_validate` path), never trusted from the client.
- `dry_run_workflow` output is labeled as sandbox output in the UI so users don't mistake it for a live run.

**Deliverable**: a user types "every Monday, summarize my unread Slack messages and email me" into the Flows page, watches the graph appear on the canvas, iterates in plain language, then clicks Save & enable.

### Phase 6 — Polish & debug tooling (stretch)

- Partial execution ("run from this node" with pinned upstream data) — needs engine support for seeding node state; scope with tinyflows maintainers.
- Run diff/inspector niceties: per-item data browser (n8n's table/JSON toggle), input↔output pairing via `paired_item`.
- `flows_duplicate`, run retention/pruning policy, per-flow run-history limits.
- Desktop E2E (WDIO) spec: create → run → inspect happy path.

### Phase 7 — Engine (vendor/tinyflows) upstream work

Tracked separately since it's a submodule with its own release cadence (host pins `0.3`, patched to path):

1. `agent` node sub-ports (chat_model/memory/tool/output_parser wiring) — unlocks n8n-style "AI Agent with tools" composition.
2. `output_parser`: schema validation + LLM auto-fix (currently identity).
3. Sub-workflow by reference (4b) — config `workflow_id` alternative to inline `workflow`.
4. Docs truth-up: README/Roadmap still claim jq and retry backoff are pending; both are implemented (`src/expr.rs` routes to jaq; `engine.rs` has fixed/exponential backoff + `node_timeout_secs`).
5. Optional: cancellation token support in `engine::run` (cleaner than task-abort for 1b).

### Phase 8 — Decommission the legacy `workflows::` bundle domain

The `workflows::` domain (WORKFLOW.md/SKILL.md bundle discovery/install, RPC `openhuman.workflows_*`) predates tinyflows and is functionally the **skills** feature under a different name. Keeping two things called "workflows" confuses users, agents, and contributors alike. Plan: fold what's unique into `skills`, delete the rest, and hand the name to tinyflows.

- **Audit consumers first**: `agent/tools/run_workflow.rs` (agent tool that runs WORKFLOW.md bundles — decide: retire, or repoint to `flows_run`/skills), the `/skills` UI surfaces (`WorkflowsTab`, `CreateWorkflowForm`, `WorkflowRunnerBody`, `WorkflowNew.tsx`, `WorkflowsRun.tsx`, `DevWorkflowPanel`, `workflowsApi.ts`), `about_app`, gitbooks, and the Rhai workflow plan's references to `run_workflow` as a composition surface.
- **Migrate**: bundle discovery/install semantics that skills doesn't already cover move into the `skills` domain (it is metadata-only post-QuickJS-removal, so this is mostly file-format and registry work).
- **Deprecate then delete**: mark `openhuman.workflows_*` deprecated for one release (RPC responses carry a deprecation notice), then remove `src/openhuman/workflows/`, its controllers from `src/core/all.rs`, the frontend clients/pages, and the `/workflows/new`//`workflows/run` routes (bare `/workflows` already redirects to `/settings/automations`).
- **Not in scope**: `openhuman.workflow_run_*` (`agent_orchestration`'s declarative run ledger) is a different system and untouched here — though its name should also be revisited once "Workflows" ≡ tinyflows.
- **Naming end-state**: one user-facing concept — **Workflows = tinyflows graphs** at `/flows`; skills are skills.

## 5. Sequencing, estimates, risks

```
Phase 0 (tinyagents pin) ██          ~2–3 d    do first; touches both lockfiles
Phase 1 (backend)      ██████        ~2–3 wk   unblocks everything
Phase 2 (credentials)     ████       ~1–2 wk   parallel w/ Phase 3
Phase 3 (canvas)          ████████   ~3–4 wk   largest UI lift
Phase 4 (authoring)               ████  ~2 wk
Phase 5 (builder agent)            ██████  ~2–3 wk  needs Phase 3 canvas + Phase 2 connections
Phase 6 (polish)                      ██  opportunistic
Phase 7 (engine)       ── continuous, PR'd to vendor submodule ──
Phase 8 (decommission)   ── independent; audit early, delete after a deprecation release ──
```

**Risks / decisions to confirm:**

1. **External-event delivery model** — decided: Composio triggers are the webhook story (platform handles delivery/auth/NAT). Raw custom webhooks (own tunnel via `webhooks::ops::create_tunnel`) stay deferred; revisit only if users need non-Composio HTTP callers.
2. **Prompt-injection surface** — webhook/app_event payloads feeding `agent` nodes are untrusted; must go through the `prompt_injection` domain. Non-negotiable before G1 ships.
3. **Editable canvas vs. agent-first authoring** — product stance so far is "the agent builds it, you approve it" (`gitbooks/features/workflows.md`). Phase 5 makes that stance first-class in the Flows UI itself (prompt bar + canvas copilot); the Phase 3 hand-editing canvas is the escape hatch, not the headline. Keep the prompt-first path primary in onboarding copy so the two don't compete.
4. **GPL-3.0 licensing** of `vendor/tinyflows` — already vendored/linked; re-confirm distribution posture before expanding surface (flag for legal, not an engineering blocker).
5. **Submodule cadence** — engine changes (Phase 7) must land in the tinyflows repo and re-vendor; keep host-side workarounds (e.g. by-id sub-workflow resolution in caps) so UI phases aren't blocked on vendor releases.

**Per-repo conventions that apply to all phases**: new RPCs go through domain `schemas.rs` + controller registry (no `dispatch.rs` branches); ≥80 % diff coverage gate; verbose `[flows]`-prefixed debug logging on every new path; i18n keys added to `en.ts` **and all 13 locales**; update `src/openhuman/platform/about_app/` and `gitbooks/features/workflows.md` as features land.
