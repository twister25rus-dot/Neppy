# Installing OpenHuman

Download installers from [tinyhumans.ai/openhuman](https://tinyhumans.ai/openhuman?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme) or from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/releases/latest) page. For terminal installs, the native package paths below are preferred because they use your OS package manager or native installer where available.

## Recommended install (native packages)

These paths use native installer surfaces. Homebrew and MSI provide their normal signing/integrity checks; Debian/Ubuntu uses `apt-get` to install the release `.deb` and resolve system dependencies.

**macOS (Homebrew Cask):**

```bash
brew install --cask openhuman
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, release `.deb`):**

```bash
# Download OpenHuman_<version>_amd64.deb or OpenHuman_<version>_arm64.deb
# from https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/releases/latest, then:
# Replace amd64 with arm64 on arm64 hosts.
sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ./OpenHuman_*_amd64.deb
```

**Linux (Arch, AUR):** the [`openhuman-bin` AUR recipe](./packages/arch/openhuman-bin/) is in the repo. Once published, Arch users can install it with `yay -S openhuman-bin`.

**Windows:** download the signed `.msi` from the [latest release](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/releases/latest) and run it.

**Manual `.dmg` / `.deb` / `.AppImage` / `.msi`:** grab the installer for your platform directly from the [latest release page](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/releases/latest).

> **Linux:** the AppImage can crash on launch under Wayland, miss host system libraries such as `libgbm.so.1`, or fail on Arch-based distros with `sharun: Interpreter not found!`. See [#2463](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/issues/2463) for the cause and env-var workarounds. The `.deb` package above avoids those failure modes on Debian/Ubuntu by letting apt resolve runtime dependencies.

## Alternative: script install (no integrity check)

> **Warning: unverified install.** These scripts are served live from `raw.githubusercontent.com` and do **not** ship a separate signature, so `curl … | bash` and `irm … | iex` have no way to detect tampering of the script bytes. Prefer the **native package** paths above whenever possible. If you must use the script, see "Verified script install status" below.

```bash
# macOS or Linux x64
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

On Debian/Ubuntu, `install.sh` resolves the latest release `.deb` first and installs it with `apt-get` so runtime dependencies are handled by apt. Set `OPENHUMAN_INSTALLER_LINUX_PACKAGE=appimage` to force the AppImage path.

## Verified script install status

A separately signed script-install path is not currently available. Issue [#2620](https://github.com/tinyhumansai/openhuman/issues/2620) is closed after the native package paths were promoted, but current release assets do not include `install.sh.asc` / `install.ps1.asc` for pre-execution script verification. Treat the script install path as unverified and prefer the native package options above when possible.
